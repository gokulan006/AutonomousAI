 Rekha Gupta on Sunday accused the Arvind Kejriwal-led past government of draining the Union territory coffers and assured implementation of BJP's poll promise to pay Rs 2,500 every month to women in the national capital. 
Gupta, the first-time MLA from Shalimar Bagh, said the scheme of monetary assistance to women would be rolled out after detailed planning.

The Delhi CM attended a meeting along with other BJP MLAs at the state party office ahead of the first session of the newly constituted 8th 
Delhi Assembly
 scheduled on Monday.
Addressing a press conference after the meeting, the newly appointed CM said several phases of meetings have been held with the officers over the implementation of the 
Mahila Samriddhi Yojna
 under which Rs 2,500 per month is to be paid to the eligible women in Delhi.
On Saturday, AAP leader Atishi wrote to 
Rekha Gupta
 requesting a meeting with the AAP legislative delegation to discuss the implementation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's electoral promise of Rs2,500 monthly assistance for women. 
The letter comes after the BJP's first cabinet meeting on February 20 did not address the scheme that was promised during Modi's election rally in Dwarka.
Accusing the Congress and AAP of neglecting the people of Delhi, Gupta said, ""Congress ruled Delhi for 15 years and after that it was the AAP... yet, they never addressed the issues of the people of Delhi. And now, just one day after we took office, they have started questioning our government."" 
Highlighting her party's swift action, she mentioned, “We approved the Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme in our first cabinet meeting—a scheme AAP stalled for years. We took oath and immediately fulfilled this promise.” 
Gupta suggested that Congress and AAP should focus on their internal matters, stating, “Many of their members are ready to leave, and they are worried because we are committed to fulfilling all our promises.” She also claimed that the opposition feared her government’s transparency. 
“They are scared because we will present reports in the first assembly session that were never submitted before. The truth about their actions will be revealed to the people,” she said. 
Reaffirming her commitment to the public, Gupta assured that her government would keep all its promises. 
“We started our work on day one by visiting Yamuna Ghat, and we are determined to fulfill 100 per cent of our commitments,” she added.

BJP
 holds a majority with 48 MLAs.
She has become the first woman to hold this position in the assembly.

""In the legislative party meeting today, it has been unanimously decided that Atishi will be the leader of the opposition in the Delhi Assembly. In challenging times, Atishi has served the people of Delhi as the CM. AAP will fulfil the responsibility of a healthy opposition,"" Gopal Rai stated.
Former Delhi CM and party head 
Arvind Kejriwal
 congratulated Atishi on X: ""I congratulate Atishi ji for being elected as leader of AAP in the House. AAP will play the role of constructive opposition in the interest of people of Delhi.""
Atishi thanked Kejriwal and the party's elected MLAs for entrusting her with the responsibility.
Former Delhi CM and prominent AAP leader Atishi secured her Kalkaji seat after a tough contest against former BJP MP Ramesh Bidhuri and Congress leader Alka Lamba.
Last year in September, she was named as the Delhi CM during a meeting of AAP MLAs at Kejriwal's residence. At 43, Atishi became the youngest Delhi CM in history and was sworn-in on September 21.
Kejriwal chose to resign to test the public's faith in him and secure a fresh majority mandate for the party. However, AAP failed to continue its winning streak in the capital.
Meanwhile, the BJP took office on Thursday after the oath-taking ceremony at Ramlila Maidan, with Shalimar Bagh MLA Rekha Gupta becoming Delhi's chief minister. She is the fourth woman to hold this position in the national capital.
The BJP announced its chief ministerial face at the last moment as part of its political strategy, after considering several contenders for the role.
Along with CM Rekha Gupta, six others were appointed as ministers: Parvesh Verma, Ashish Sood, Kapil Mishra, Manjinder Singh Sirsa, Ravinder Kumar Indraj, and Pankaj Kumar Singh.
Returning to power after 27 years, the BJP defeated major AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal in New Delhi, Manish Sisodia in Jangpura, and Saurabh Bharadwaj in Greater Kailash.
The AAP dominated the 2020 and 2015 Delhi elections with landslide victories, winning 67 and 62 seats, respectively. It reduced the BJP to single digits on both occasions and prevented the Congress from securing any seats, ending the party's long 15-year reign under Sheila Dikshit.

NEW DELHI: Punjab minister Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal on Sunday responded to the abolition of the 'non-existent' 
department of administrative reforms
 by the 
Punjab government
, stating that the department's existence is secondary to Punjab's welfare, which remains the government's primary focus.
Speaking to news agency ANI, Dhaliwal said, “They have now abolished the department.

We have all come to save Punjab. For me, the department is not important; Punjab is important. (Whether this department exists or not) is not an agenda for us”.
A notification issued on February 21 confirmed that the department, which Dhaliwal was assigned alongside 
NRI Affairs
, ""does not exist.""
“In partial modification of Punjab Government Notification No. 2/1/2022-2Cabinet/2230 dated September 23, 2024, regarding allocation of portfolios amongst the Ministers, the Department of 
Administrative Reforms
 earlier allotted to Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal, Cabinet Minister, is not in existence as on date,” the notification read.
The move triggered a response from BJP, who criticised the AAP government in Punjab, with Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri leading the charge against Dhaliwal for managing a ""non-existent"" department for 20 months.
Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri questioned how Dhaliwal had been running a department for 20 months that did not exist. “He was heading a department for 20 months which is ‘non-existent.’ Such a thing can happen only under the leadership of the AAP government,” Puri said.
BJP leader Fatehjung Singh Bajwa accused the Mann government of poor governance, saying, “Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal is one of the most senior leaders of the Cabinet and he was leading a non-existent Department, which means no meeting was ever taken… What kind of administrative reforms are being taken? People are going abroad through dunki routes, and no agent or tout who sent them was ever caught... This state government has taken Punjab back by 50 years”.
Defending his government’s move, 
Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann
 clarified that the department was merged with another to streamline governance. “We changed its name and created a new department. Earlier it was just for the name, there was no staff or office. Now, it has been created to bring reforms, whether it is in bureaucracy or other areas,” ANI quoted Mann.
Mann further explained that similar restructuring is being planned for other departments. “There are two departments – the department of administrative reforms and the one held by cabinet minister Aman Arora (governance reforms). There was confusion between the two. We have made it one proper department,” he said.
He also mentioned that other departments with overlapping functions, such as irrigation, water conservation, and drainage, may be consolidated to improve efficiency.
The department of aministrative reforms had reportedly been ‘redundant’ for some time. Officials pointed out that it existed only on paper, had no dedicated officers and no significant meetings or initiatives had taken place.
Dhaliwal, who now holds only the NRI affairs portfolio, has been in the spotlight, particularly after the US deported 
illegal migrants
 to Amritsar earlier this month. Previously, in a cabinet reshuffle in May 2023, Dhaliwal lost key portfolios such as agriculture and rural development, with administrative reforms being handed to him after the exit of Inderbir Singh Nijjar.
However, its role remained unclear as the state’s good governance and IT departments were already handling administrative efficiency improvements.

"Won’t give in to ‘blackmail’, Centre makes it clear to Tamil Nadu",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wont-give-in-to-blackmail-centre-makes-it-clear-to-tn/articleshow/118490049.cms,Tamil Nadu,General News,"Won’t give in to ‘blackmail’, Centre makes it clear to TN (Pic credit: PTI)
 
NEW DELHI: In the midst of its escalating political standoff with Tamil Nadu govt over National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, Centre has made it clear that it is firmly committed to implementing the three-language policy at school level. Centre is steadfast in its stance and will not succumb to Tamil Nadu's ""blackmailing"" tactics, govt sources said.
Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, in a letter to Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Friday, criticised the state's opposition to NE, calling it ""highly inappropriate"" and a ""narrow-minded approach"". Pradhan sought to allay concerns raised by Tamil Nadu govt, saying, ""Let me unequivocally state that there is no question of imposing any language on any state or community.""
NE advocates a flexible three-language formula, emphasising multilingual education, while allowing states to choose their own languages within the framework. However, Tamil Nadu govt has consistently opposed the policy, arguing that it undermines the state's long-standing two-language formula and poses a potential threat to linguistic identity.
Despite the state's reservations, Union govt remains firm on implementing NE nationwide. Centre maintains that the policy is designed to enhance educational outcomes and foster multilingual proficiency without infringing upon regional linguistic preferences. Pradhan underscored this in his letter, stating, ""NE upholds the principle of linguistic freedom and ensures that students continue to learn in the language of their choice.""
""Apart from BJP-governed states there are multiple non-BJP states which are implementing this language policy. In fact, states like Assam and Odisha, among others, have been following a three-language formula till Class VIII which predates BJP govts there,"" said a senior govt official.
The three-language policy, which has been a part of India's education framework since 1968, has been a major point of contention for long. Pradhan argued that its lack of proper implementation over the decades has led to a decline in the systematic teaching of Indian languages and an over-reliance on foreign languages. ""NE seeks to correct this historical oversight by ensuring that every Indian language, including Tamil, receives its rightful place in education while maintaining the flexibility for states to design their own language policies,"" he wrote.
Pradhan cautioned that Tamil Nadu's continued opposition to NE could deprive its students, teachers, and educational institutions of the immense opportunities the policy offers.

The conductor had an argument with the college student when she insisted that he speak to her in Marathi, after he demanded that her male companion buy a ticket for the ride. Later, around 20 people boarded the bus at Balekundri and beat up the driver and conductor. 
Kannada outfits that had already expressed their ire over the attack on the crew, raised the pitch several notches higher on Saturday.
Condemning the incident and registering of a case against the conductor under the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, activists of Karnataka Nava Nirmana Sene blackened the face of a 
Maharashtra bus conductor
 and the front windshield of a bus in Chitradurga on Saturday. Meanwhile, 
Karnataka Rakshana Vedike
 activists protested outside Marihal police station and at Channamma Circle.
Police have arrested four persons so far, including a minor, in connection with the assault. While three of them were remanded in judicial custody for 14 days, the minor was sent to a remand home on Friday night. 
The incident led to disruption in bus services between Karnataka and Maharashtra, with Kannada outfits in Karnataka and Shiv Sena activists on the Maharashtra side of the border protesting.
Police commissioner Iada Martin Marbaniang said: ""Three teams have been formed to search for the remaining accused. The victim was a minor girl, and a complaint was filed on her behalf under Section 12 of the Pocso Act against the conductor.""
Police said precautionary measures have been taken to maintain law and order, and SPs along the Karnataka-Maharashtra border will be told to share information about the steps to be taken to prevent any untoward incident.

People are going abroad through dunki routes, and no agent or tout who sent them was ever caught... This state government has taken Punjab back by 50 years”.
Defending his government’s move, 
Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann
 clarified that the department was merged with another to streamline governance. “We changed its name and created a new department. Earlier it was just for the name, there was no staff or office. Now, it has been created to bring reforms, whether it is in bureaucracy or other areas,” ANI quoted Mann.
Mann further explained that similar restructuring is being planned for other departments. “There are two departments – the department of administrative reforms and the one held by cabinet minister Aman Arora (governance reforms). There was confusion between the two. We have made it one proper department,” he said.
He also mentioned that other departments with overlapping functions, such as irrigation, water conservation, and drainage, may be consolidated to improve efficiency.
The department of aministrative reforms had reportedly been ‘redundant’ for some time. Officials pointed out that it existed only on paper, had no dedicated officers and no significant meetings or initiatives had taken place.
Dhaliwal, who now holds only the NRI affairs portfolio, has been in the spotlight, particularly after the US deported 
illegal migrants
 to Amritsar earlier this month. Previously, in a cabinet reshuffle in May 2023, Dhaliwal lost key portfolios such as agriculture and rural development, with administrative reforms being handed to him after the exit of Inderbir Singh Nijjar.
However, its role remained unclear as the state’s good governance and IT departments were already handling administrative efficiency improvements.

Delhi ministers hit the roads to undertake surprise inspections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-ministers-hit-the-roads-to-undertake-surprise-inspections/articleshow/118493090.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"Delhi ministers hit the roads to undertake surprise inspections
 
NEW DELHI: Newly sworn-in Delhi ministers spent the day on Saturday doing a reality check on the ground by carrying surprise inspections and asking officials to fast-track projects that have been delayed or are stuck.
PWD minister Parvesh Verma undertook an extensive review of projects in and around Mathura Road and Ring Road, zeroing in on the work on Barapullah flyover's extension, which has got inordinately delayed.
""I was told that no minister had visited the project for a decade and no one even cared to get it completed even as the city is grappling with traffic jams,"" he said, adding that all this only made the city air more polluted.
""If you delay a project, it also leads to cost escalation. The AAP govt didn't care about these things. I have asked for details of whatever clearances they need, and I will personally ensure that there are no further hindrances,"" he said. ""The road will be opened to the public in the next 12 months. Money is not an issue.""
Ensure timely completion of works: Verma 
 Explaining what plagues Delhi roads, Verma said these were repeatedly dug up by various agencies for laying underground cables or for other work. ""This is not the way to operate. We will have a nodal agency that will ensure all underground work is completed before a road is constructed so that the taxpayers' money is not wasted,"" Verma said. He emphasised the need for better coordination to prevent wastage of funds.
Verma also reviewed the progress in construction of the Bhairon Marg underpass, part of the Pragati Maidan tunnel, and the Sarai Kale Khan stretch. He directed officials to ensure timely completion of all work. Emphasising the importance of quality construction, he said, ""We should build a road that lasts for 10-15 years. Though the official lifespan is five years, the quality should be such that it remains in good condition for at least 10-15 years.""
He also inspected the Moolchand underpass, which has in the past witnessed severe waterlogging. To address this long-standing issue, he reviewed the upgradation of facilities with Japanese pumps being installed to make the drainage more effective.
""I have directed officials to take all necessary measures before the rainy season to ensure that water does not accumulate. Proper drainage systems should be created and maintained, and pumps should be installed in time,"" he said.
Verma said these efforts were in line with PM Modi's vision of a cleaner, greener and more developed Delhi. ""We are committed to transforming Delhi into a world-class city with better roads, effective drainage systems and overall beautification,"" he added.
Education minister Ashish Sood visited Janakpuri and expressed his dismay over the accumulation of garbage. ""It has been lying scattered over a 1km stretch over the past two and a half years. This is unacceptable. People are hassled about AAP councillors. We are committed to cleaning this up,"" he said.
Health minister Pankaj Kumar Singh visited 
Rao Tula Ram Memorial Hospital
 in Jaffarpur Kalan along with BJP MP Kamaljeet Sehrawat. ""The conditions here are quite bad. There is a lack of doctors. A building that should have been made before 2020 is incomplete. We have decided with Sehrawat that in 3 months, we will transform this hospital,"" he said. ""We will come back here after three months to show you how well this hospital is functioning.""
On the mohalla clinics, he said: ""There are many clinics that do not have doctors or medicines. They were leased out by MLAs in the name of clinics. If these complaints are true, the matter will be investigated,"" he said.

8 workers trapped as roof of Telangana tunnel caves in,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/8-workers-trapped-as-roof-of-telangana-tunnel-caves-in/articleshow/118490342.cms,Telangana,General News,"NDRF personnel assist in rescue operations after a portion of the Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) tunnel near Domalpenta collapsed, in Nagarkurnool on Saturday. (Pic credit: ANI)
 
HYDERABAD: Eight people were trapped inside when a portion of the tunnel roof at 
Srisailam Left Bank Canal
 (SLBC) collapsed on Saturday morning near Domalpenta in Telangana's Nagarku-nool district.
Sources said 60 workers were on site when the roof suddenly caved in by about 200 metres inside the tunnel, which has a depth of 500 ft. While 52 of them managed to come out to safety, with some of them taken to hospital with injuries, eight workers remained trapped deep inside the tunnel.
These included 
Jaiprakash Associates
 Limited project engineer Manoj Kumar and field engineer Sri Niwas, both from Uttar Pradesh, four labourers from Jharkhand - Sandeep Sahu, Jataks, Santosh Sahu and Anuj Sahu - and two machine operators of Robbins India Company - Sunny Singh from J&K and Gurpreet Singh from Punjab.
According to sources, no communication had been established with the trapped people till reports last came in. Noises of shifting of boulders were heard till evening, indicating that the roof in collapsed areas was still unstable, the sources said.
PM Narendra Modi dialled chief minister A Revanth Reddy to inquire about the mishap and assured all possible assistance from the Centre, including deployment of 
National Disaster Response Force
 (NDRF) personnel, for the ongoing rescue operation.
According to senior irrigation officials, the tunnel roof collapsed due to a sudden leakage of water and soil, covering nearly 13 km of the excavation site. The SLBC tunnel is about 44 km long from the Srisailam dam's left bank. 
The accident occurred about 13 km from the mouth of the tunnel. An earth fracture on the side of the tunnel wall caused the water and mud to gush in, forcing the workers to scramble to safety.
Jaiprakash Associates and Robbins India, responsible for tunnel boring, said the accident took place within 30 minutes of taking up the work at 8 am. Those positioned near the tunnel boring machine managed to escape, while workers in the front section of the tunnel got trapped, representatives of the companies said. The works were immediately halted, and supervisors quickly evacuated as many workers as possible. 
Officials said the ventilation system inside the tunnel remained functional, ensuring oxygen supply to the trapped workers. The Army teams are expected to arrive at the site by Saturday night.

"Won’t give in to ‘blackmail’, Centre makes it clear to Tamil Nadu",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wont-give-in-to-blackmail-centre-makes-it-clear-to-tn/articleshow/118490049.cms,Tamil Nadu,General News,"Won’t give in to ‘blackmail’, Centre makes it clear to TN (Pic credit: PTI)
 
NEW DELHI: In the midst of its escalating political standoff with Tamil Nadu govt over National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, Centre has made it clear that it is firmly committed to implementing the three-language policy at school level. Centre is steadfast in its stance and will not succumb to Tamil Nadu's ""blackmailing"" tactics, govt sources said.
Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, in a letter to Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Friday, criticised the state's opposition to NE, calling it ""highly inappropriate"" and a ""narrow-minded approach"". Pradhan sought to allay concerns raised by Tamil Nadu govt, saying, ""Let me unequivocally state that there is no question of imposing any language on any state or community.""
NE advocates a flexible three-language formula, emphasising multilingual education, while allowing states to choose their own languages within the framework. However, Tamil Nadu govt has consistently opposed the policy, arguing that it undermines the state's long-standing two-language formula and poses a potential threat to linguistic identity.
Despite the state's reservations, Union govt remains firm on implementing NE nationwide. Centre maintains that the policy is designed to enhance educational outcomes and foster multilingual proficiency without infringing upon regional linguistic preferences. Pradhan underscored this in his letter, stating, ""NE upholds the principle of linguistic freedom and ensures that students continue to learn in the language of their choice.""
""Apart from BJP-governed states there are multiple non-BJP states which are implementing this language policy. In fact, states like Assam and Odisha, among others, have been following a three-language formula till Class VIII which predates BJP govts there,"" said a senior govt official.
The three-language policy, which has been a part of India's education framework since 1968, has been a major point of contention for long. Pradhan argued that its lack of proper implementation over the decades has led to a decline in the systematic teaching of Indian languages and an over-reliance on foreign languages. ""NE seeks to correct this historical oversight by ensuring that every Indian language, including Tamil, receives its rightful place in education while maintaining the flexibility for states to design their own language policies,"" he wrote.
Pradhan cautioned that Tamil Nadu's continued opposition to NE could deprive its students, teachers, and educational institutions of the immense opportunities the policy offers.

The Delhi assembly's first session will begin on February 24, where MLAs will take their oath and elect a new Speaker.
""The report will be tabled in the House and many things will come to light. I think the truth will come out in the CAG report. Whether it is education, liquor, or Sheesh Mahal, many such issues will be raised in the House,"" said Khurana.
Khurana criticized AAP for not presenting the report earlier, emphasizing that the new BJP-led government would operate according to constitutional norms.
""The 8th assembly formed yesterday and its first session will begin tomorrow with the oath of the MLAs and the election of the Speaker and the next day the CAG report will be tabled. This report should have been tabled in the 7th Assembly, as per the rules. But now whatever work the Delhi government will do will be done as per the rules, as per the Constitution,"" Khurana stated.
AAP's national spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar responded by questioning BJP's commitment to their campaign promises, particularly regarding the Rs 2,500 financial assistance scheme for Delhi women.
""BJP should display optimistic politics. They should work on the promises they made to the people of Delhi instead of imposing their agenda. They said that in the first cabinet meeting, a resolution would be passed that every woman in Delhi would get Rs 2500 per month in her account,"" Kakkar said.
Kakkar pointed out that BJP had not addressed their promises in their first cabinet meeting, contrasting this with AAP's record of fulfilling their commitments when they came to power.

MSRTC workers' union said the security of bus drivers and conductors is now at stake.
On Saturday, the MSRTC cancelled 250 buses that operate between Maharashtra and Karnataka in the wake of the violence. Six of these buses operate from Pune. Abhijit Bhosle, the MSRTC public relations officer, said it is not certain whether the buses would operate on Sunday. ""We will take a call after consultation with police. At this moment, nothing can be said,"" the official told TOI. 
As the MSRTC buses towards Karnataka did not ply on Saturday, more than 20 buses from the Kolhapur Central bus stand were cancelled. Passengers were stranded at the bus stand.
Shiv Sena (UBT) workers protested against the incident at the Kolhapur Central bus stand on Saturday morning. They put up saffron flags on the Karnataka State Road Transport buses and raised slogans against the Karnataka govt. Shahupuri police detained the Shiv Sena (UBT) workers.
Vijay Dewane, the district convenor of Shiv Sena (UBT), said, ""The Maharashtra chief minister should immediately stop all the Karnataka buses from entering our state. Karnataka govt should apologise for this act, else a befitting reply will be given.""
The Maharashtra-Karnataka border dispute has been going on for several years now. Whenever the border dispute flares up, the first to bear the brunt often are the state transport buses. 
MSRTC bus conductor Prashant Thorat, who was in the bus that was attacked on Friday, said, ""Our driver, Bhaskar Jadhav, was driving the Bengaluru-Pune MSRTC bus from Chitradurga to Kolhapur when, around 9.30pm, activists of the Karnataka Navanirman Sene turned up in four to five vehicles and blocked the way. The activists, carrying red-yellow flags and scarves, the Jadhav if he could speak in Kannada. When the driver said no, he was pulled out of the bus. His face was blackened. The activists raised slogans screaming ‘If you can't speak Kannada, then you will not be allowed into Karnataka'. Black ink was also splashed on the bus. This continued for half an hour. Our bus was stranded there till 4 am and we, including all the passengers, were very scared as we didn't know the Kannada language either."" 
Repercussions of this incident are now likely to be felt in parts of Maharashtra as well. Uttam Patil, the divisional secretary of the MSRTC workers' union, said, ""There should be coordination between the two states regarding interstate traffic. The number of passengers travelling from Maharashtra to Karnataka is huge. If the corporation takes responsibility for the safety of drivers and conductors, we have no problem in going to Karnataka. MSRTC drivers and the general public are being dragged into the organisational and political tussle. The transport corporations of both states should sit together and decide on safety.""

8 workers trapped as roof of Telangana tunnel caves in,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/8-workers-trapped-as-roof-of-telangana-tunnel-caves-in/articleshow/118490342.cms,Telangana,General News,"NDRF personnel assist in rescue operations after a portion of the Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) tunnel near Domalpenta collapsed, in Nagarkurnool on Saturday.

HYDERABAD: Eight people were trapped inside when a portion of the tunnel roof at 
Srisailam Left Bank Canal
 (SLBC) collapsed on Saturday morning near Domalpenta in Telangana's Nagarku-nool district.
Sources said 60 workers were on site when the roof suddenly caved in by about 200 metres inside the tunnel, which has a depth of 500 ft. While 52 of them managed to come out to safety, with some of them taken to hospital with injuries, eight workers remained trapped deep inside the tunnel.
These included 
Jaiprakash Associates
 Limited project engineer Manoj Kumar and field engineer Sri Niwas, both from Uttar Pradesh, four labourers from Jharkhand - Sandeep Sahu, Jataks, Santosh Sahu and Anuj Sahu - and two machine operators of Robbins India Company - Sunny Singh from J&K and Gurpreet Singh from Punjab.
According to sources, no communication had been established with the trapped people till reports last came in. Noises of shifting of boulders were heard till evening, indicating that the roof in collapsed areas was still unstable, the sources said.
PM Narendra Modi dialled chief minister A Revanth Reddy to inquire about the mishap and assured all possible assistance from the Centre, including deployment of 
National Disaster Response Force
 (NDRF) personnel, for the ongoing rescue operation.
According to senior irrigation officials, the tunnel roof collapsed due to a sudden leakage of water and soil, covering nearly 13 km of the excavation site. The SLBC tunnel is about 44 km long from the Srisailam dam's left bank. 
The accident occurred about 13 km from the mouth of the tunnel. An earth fracture on the side of the tunnel wall caused the water and mud to gush in, forcing the workers to scramble to safety.
Jaiprakash Associates and Robbins India, responsible for tunnel boring, said the accident took place within 30 minutes of taking up the work at 8 am. Those positioned near the tunnel boring machine managed to escape, while workers in the front section of the tunnel got trapped, representatives of the companies said. The works were immediately halted, and supervisors quickly evacuated as many workers as possible. 
Officials said the ventilation system inside the tunnel remained functional, ensuring oxygen supply to the trapped workers. The Army teams are expected to arrive at the site by Saturday night.

"Won’t give in to ‘blackmail’, Centre makes it clear to Tamil Nadu",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wont-give-in-to-blackmail-centre-makes-it-clear-to-tn/articleshow/118490049.cms,Tamil Nadu,General News,"Won’t give in to ‘blackmail’, Centre makes it clear to TN (Pic credit: PTI)
 
NEW DELHI: In the midst of its escalating political standoff with Tamil Nadu govt over National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, Centre has made it clear that it is firmly committed to implementing the three-language policy at school level. Centre is steadfast in its stance and will not succumb to Tamil Nadu's ""blackmailing"" tactics, govt sources said.
Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, in a letter to Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Friday, criticised the state's opposition to NE, calling it ""highly inappropriate"" and a ""narrow-minded approach"". Pradhan sought to allay concerns raised by Tamil Nadu govt, saying, ""Let me unequivocally state that there is no question of imposing any language on any state or community.""
NE advocates a flexible three-language formula, emphasising multilingual education, while allowing states to choose their own languages within the framework. However, Tamil Nadu govt has consistently opposed the policy, arguing that it undermines the state's long-standing two-language formula and poses a potential threat to linguistic identity.
Despite the state's reservations, Union govt remains firm on implementing NE nationwide. Centre maintains that the policy is designed to enhance educational outcomes and foster multilingual proficiency without infringing upon regional linguistic preferences. Pradhan underscored this in his letter, stating, ""NE upholds the principle of linguistic freedom and ensures that students continue to learn in the language of their choice.""
""Apart from BJP-governed states there are multiple non-BJP states which are implementing this language policy. In fact, states like Assam and Odisha, among others, have been following a three-language formula till Class VIII which predates BJP govts there,"" said a senior govt official.
The three-language policy, which has been a part of India's education framework since 1968, has been a major point of contention for long. Pradhan argued that its lack of proper implementation over the decades has led to a decline in the systematic teaching of Indian languages and an over-reliance on foreign languages. ""NE seeks to correct this historical oversight by ensuring that every Indian language, including Tamil, receives its rightful place in education while maintaining the flexibility for states to design their own language policies,"" he wrote.
Pradhan cautioned that Tamil Nadu's continued opposition to NE could deprive its students, teachers, and educational institutions of the immense opportunities the policy offers.

""Our sisters get a 50% concession, senior citizens also get concessions for years in buses, and due to those concessions, the situation has become such that MSRTC buses are losing Rs 3 crore each day. If we keep giving concessions to everyone, I think it will be difficult to run MSRTC,"" said Sarnaik.
With buzz that the concession for women and senior citizens will be shut in MSRTC, DCM Ekanth Shinde stepped in and clarified that none of the concessions will be stopped.
""The 
Majhi Ladki Bahin scheme

Earlier this month, the state govt-appointed additional chief secretary (transport) Sanjay Sethi as chairperson MSRTC. Sarnaik was keen to get the post as in the past, all Sena transport ministers, such as Diwakar Raote and Anil Parab, were appointed MSRTC chairperson. Until recently, Sena MLA Bharat Gogawale was MSRTC chairperson. He resigned after he became a minister in the current Mahayuti govt.

NEP row: Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin talks of not paying central taxes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nep-row-tamil-nadu-chief-minister-m-k-stalin-talks-of-not-paying-central-taxes/articleshow/118462495.cms,Tamil Nadu,General News,"CUDDALORE:

 and devolution of funds, saying it would take 
DMK
 ""just one second to say we won't pay tax that Union govt is collecting from the state,"" reports Bosco Dominique. ""Federalism is about give-and-take,"" Stalin said here. 
Referring to Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan's statement that TN stood to lose Rs 5,000 crore for not rolling out PM Shri scheme linked to NEP, Stalin said Centre was jealous of states' growth and was trying to impede their development.
Ditch politics for students’ sake, Pradhan tells Stalin on NEP
Accusing the Centre of not giving states their rightful share of resources, Stalin said: “After sucking out all state taxes through the GST regime, the Union govt is refusing to disburse the dues of states. They are refusing to announce new schemes or release funds even for joint projects of the state and Union govts.”
Stalin warned: “Don’t hurl stones at a beehive. Don’t provoke the unique spirit of Tamil people. Don’t seek to witness resurgence of Tamil defiance. As long as I am here, as long as DMK is here, no anti-Tamil, anti-Tamil Nadu, or anti-Tamilian agenda will succeed.”
Pradhan countered Stalin’s opposition to NEP, saying TN’s stance was politically motivated and harmful to students. He shared a letter addressed to Stalin on his X handle, mentioning that it was “highly inappropriate” for a state to oppose NEP with a “narrow-minded approach”. Pradhan accused the TN govt of using “intimidation for political reasons”. He said the Modi govt was fully committed to promoting Tamil culture globally and urged TN to “not politicise education” and instead work “beyond political differences in the best interest of our students”. Pradhan argued NE was a transformative policy aimed at modernising India’s education system while preserving linguistic and cultural diversity. Rejecting allegations of Hindi being imposed on southern states, he said, “Let me unequivocally state there is no question of imposing any language on any state or community.” Stalin told the gathering in Cuddalore that the “real disaster for India” was the Union govt’s alleged failure to understand the fundamental principle of federalism. “NEP is not designed to promote education but to advance the agenda of making India a homogenous nation,” he said.

Rekha Gupta
 told TOI in an exclusive interview on Friday, just over 30 hours after being sworn in, that dealing with pollution has to be a year-round activity and her govt will have a 365-day plan.
The 
BJP
 govt, sworn in on Thursday, has already indicated its resolve to clean the Yamuna in a time-bound manner. Environmentalists and people concerned over the worsening air pollution in the city have been pointing out that waking up just before winter with a band-aid approach doesn't mitigate pollution. The chief minister seems to agree with that.
""We believe that work on pollution has to be carried out around the year, be it dust or parali (stubble), vehicular or water pollution. Therefore, we will bring a 365-day plan,"" she said.
Concerned about any water or power crisis this summer because of rising demand, Gupta said a long-term plan will be drafted to seek water from UP, Uttarakhand, Haryana and Punjab. ""I am Haryana's daughter too and I will ask them for more water,"" she said, hopefully. Except for Punjab, all these states have BJP govts.
When asked about the criteria for 
Mahila Samriddhi Yojana
 under which Rs 2,500 will be given to women as promised in BJP's manifesto, Gupta said welfare measures should benefit the deprived sections first.
She expressed concern about the state of the treasury in Delhi and said they would tap additional resources and check wastage to ensure that enough funds are available for the social welfare schemes.
The chief minister said they didn't intend to carry out a political witch hunt but an SIT will be formed to probe the ""corruption sagas"" of the Kejriwal and Atishi govts.

Although Shafiq Ansari has now been proven innocent, he no longer has a house of his own. His home was bulldozed by the administration less than 10 days after the woman filed the complaint in March 2021. ""I had built the house on 4,000sqft of land with my hard-earned savings. Now, there's only rubble. We are staying in my brother's house,"" Ansari (58) told TOI Friday.
""We had all the papers. It was alleged that the house was built without permission, but we were not provided a chance to show records or say anything. It was simply torn down. I have a family of seven. They all suffered. I went to jail for three months,"" said Ansari, a former corporator of Sarangpur civic body, around 130km from Bhopal. As per the woman's complaint on March 4, 2021, Ansari called her to his house on Feb 4, 2021, on the pretext of offering help for her son's wedding but raped her.
Ansari's house was demolished on March 13, 2021. ""They came at 7am. The administration arrived with bulldozers, and before my family members could understand anything, my house was in ruins. I was absconding at that time. I surrendered the next day,"" Ansari said.
The verdict came on Feb 14 this year. First additional sessions ju dge of Rajgarh district, Chitrendra Singh Solanki, noted ""significant inconsistencies"" in the testimonies of the woman and her husband. The court observed that although there is a police station close to her house, which was demolished, she did not report the alleged rape immediately. For 15 days after her son's wedding, she neither informed her husband or any of her sons about the alleged crime, and no reason was given for this delay, the court noted. No human sperm was found on samples of the complainant, the order said, concluding that rape could not be confirmed from clinical and scientific evidence.
Ansari plans to move court seeking justice for the demolition of his house.

 on Friday said there has never been any animosity among 
Indian languages
 and each has enriched the other.
Addressing the inaugural function of the 98th Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan in New Delhi, Modi said when efforts were made to create divisions based on languages, India's shared linguistic heritage gave a fitting reply. ""It is our social responsibility to distance ourselves from these misconceptions and embrace and enrich all languages,"" the PM added.
His remarks came on a day when 
Tamil Nadu
 CM M K Stalin reiterated his stand that implementation of the National Education Policy, 2020, was an attempt to impose a three-language formula throughout the country and said the state would stick to its two-language system.
The PM, meanwhile, said while languages were born in society, they also played a crucial role in shaping it. ""Language is not just a medium of communication but a carrier of our culture,"" he said, adding that today, all languages in the country were viewed as mainstream languages.
Modi highlighted that India was one of world's oldest living civilisations because it had consistently evolved, embraced new ideas, and welcomed changes. Pointing out that India's vast linguistic diversity was a testament to this evolution and served as a fundamental basis for unity, he compared language to a mother who imparted new and vast knowledge to her children without discrimination.
Modi also referred to efforts to promote education in all major languages and added that the mindset of neglecting talent due to the lack of English proficiency had changed.

"After drubbing AAP in Delhi, 'Bangal cholo' next for BJP?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-drubbing-aap-in-delhi-bangla-chalo-next-for-bjp/articleshow/118116026.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"PTI photo (File)
 
NEW DELHI: Since 2014, the BJP has been moving from one poll victory to another -- both on the national as well as the state level -- with seemingly nothing able to stand in the way of the Modi wave. 
However, one thorn in BJP's side was Delhi, where the Arvind Kejriwal-led fortress managed to survive the saffron tsunami not once, but twice.
However, 2025 proved to be a breakthrough year as the BJP broke the 27-year-old jinx to storm back to power in the Capital. It defeated the indomitable Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) by winning 48 seats in the 70-member Delhi assembly.
Bristling with confidence after acquiring the Rajdhani in the North, the party has already given clear indications that its next mission is to make inroads in the eastern state of West Bengal.
Like Delhi, making inroads in the Mamata Banerjee-ruled Bengal has been an uphill task for the BJP for the past two assembly elections.
In the 2016 assembly elections, buoyed by the majority mandate at the Centre, the BJP expected to emerge as a key party but faced an embarrassing defeat. The party won only 3 seats in the 294-seat West Bengal assembly.
In 2019, the BJP came back to power at the Centre with an even bigger mandate and by then had a decent presence in even the northeastern states, where BJP had negligible presence before 2014.
Two years down the line, the party made another attempt to breach the fortress of Mamata Banerjee but to no avail. 
In 2021, when the results trickled in, the BJP won only 77 seats with TMC winning a whopping mandate by securing victory on 215 seats. Though the BJP vote and seat share improved substantially, it was far less than the 200-seat mark the party had expected to win in the polls.
Just like Delhi in 2015 and 2020, the BJP fell flat in Bengal in 2016 and 2021.
However, with the BJP finally triumphing in Delhi, Bengal BJP leaders now see the possibility that Bengal may not be ""mission impossible"" anymore.
As BJP was celebrating its victory in the Capital on February 8, its top Bengal leader Suvendu Adhikari shot off a salvo at CM Mamata Banerjee, saying after the national capital, Bengal would vote for the BJP by uprooting ruling TMC.
""Delhi ki jeet hamari hai ... 2026 mein Bengal ki baari hai … (Delhi's victory is ours ... in 2026 it will be Bengal's turn),"" Adhikari said while reacting to BJP's massive comeback after 27 years of political exile.
Pumped by the BJP's historic win in Delhi, Bengal BJP chief and Union minister Sukanta Majumdar said Delhi's victory would serve as a morale booster for party workers in West Bengal ahead of next year's assembly elections.
BJP's Amit Malviya, who heads the party's I-T department, said that ""jitters from the Delhi results are being felt in West Bengal"" and claimed that ""nervous"" Mamata Banerjee would go solo in next year's assembly polls.
""A nervous Mamata Banerjee has told TMC MLAs that there will be NO alliance in Bengal … It is not surprising that she applies a different yardstick to the opposition in Haryana and Delhi but is unwilling to cede space for the alliance at home,"" Malviya wrote on X.

"No discontent in Punjab AAP, asserts Bhagwant Mann; all MLAs attend Delhi meet",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-discontent-in-punjab-aap-asserts-bhagwant-mann-all-mlas-attend-delhi-meet/articleshow/118157908.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"NEW DELHI: Punjab CM 
Bhagwant Mann
 on Tuesday dismissed claims by Congress and BJP of unrest brewing among AAP MLAs, tamping down speculation that the ripples from AAP's Delhi debacle may pose a risk to his govt.
Talking to reporters after the surprise move of party boss Arvind Kejriwal to summon Punjab CM, ministers, MPs and MLAs to Delhi, Mann took on Congress and said ""switching sides is Congress's culture"" and reminded Partap Singh Bajwa, the leader of opposition in Punjab, that his party drew a blank in Delhi.
Ahead of the meeting, which AAP said was attended by all 92 Punjab MLAs, Bajwa had alleged that the party was preparing the ground to oust Mann from the CM's post. He had also claimed that over 30 AAP MLAs were in touch with his party. 
Meeting sparks speculation about instability in 
Punjab AAP
 Instead of counting our MLAs, he should see how many Congress candidates won in Delhi,"" Bhagwant Mann said. Kejriwal and other senior functionaries held a meeting with Punjab functionaries to ostensibly thank them for their involvement in Delhi campaign.
According to AAP, the meeting at Kapurthala House saw all MLAs from Punjab and MPs from the state come together in what the party projected as a show of solidarity and normalcy amid the gloom of the Delhi loss. Besides Kejriwal and former deputy CM Manish Sisodia, national organisational secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Sandeep Pathak and RS MP Raghav Chadha were present.
Kejriwal is learnt to have asked the Punjab MLAs to reconnect with voters while working unitedly to pave the way for AAP's return to office in 2027. The timing of the meeting following AAP's defeat in Delhi had sparked speculation about instability in the party's Punjab unit. Asked about Bajwa's allegation that he could quit AAP with a group of MLAs, Mann said, ""Let them say so. We cultivated the party with hard work by going to every nook and corner of the state. They don't worry about their own party and find fault with others. It is Congress that has a culture of switching parties.""
BJP's newly-elected Rajouri Garden MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa claimed Mann's ""nervousness and body language"" after the meeting ""supports the conspiracy theory"" that he had spoken of on Monday. Sirsa had alleged that Kejriwal was scripting a narrative to oust Mann. 
AAP's estranged RS MP Swati Maliwal also took a dig at Kejriwal and said, ""Some people have started treating Punjab as their personal ATM. Today, massive corruption is rampant in Punjab.""

NEW DELHI: Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann on Tuesday responded to Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa's claim that 30 Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs were in contact with him. 
""Pratap Singh Bajwa has been saying this for almost three years. Let him say whatever he wants. I would ask Pratap Singh Bajwa to count how many MLAs they (Congress) have in Delhi,"" Mann told reporters. 
Mann also said, ""He (Bajwa) has been making claims earlier also that 20 MLAs or 40 MLAs are in touch with him. Let them say it. We have formed this party with our sweat and blood, going among people in villages and towns in the state.""
Poll
Do you agree with the claim made by Congress?
No, it's just political talk
Yes, it seems likely
After AAP's loss in the Delhi assembly elections, Bajwa claimed that an internal struggle would start between Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann and AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal. He also said that over 30 AAP MLAs were in contact with the Congress and were ready to switch sides. 
Congress MP Pramod Tiwari, however, denied that AAP MLAs were in touch with either the BJP or Congress. He said Congress does not support breaking other parties but is observing the political situation in Punjab. 
""BJP has a history of horse-trading and breaking parties—we have seen this in Maharashtra, Goa, Manipur also. They will try to do this in Punjab as well. As far as Congress is concerned, we do not believe in breaking parties. Our party's state leadership is monitoring the situation over there,"" Tiwari said while talking to news agency ANI. 
Earlier in the day, Mann arrived at Kapurthala House in New Delhi for a meeting with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal amid reports of differences within AAP. 
""Our MLAs reached here, and we had a meeting with party national convenor Arvind Kejriwal. He thanked them all for campaigning during the Delhi Assembly elections. Our government in Punjab has always worked for public welfare, whether in education or infrastructure. We need to speed up… Winning and losing is a part of the game. People of Delhi still remember us as someone who worked for them. We have two years more in Punjab. We will make Punjab a good model,"" Mann told the media. 
AAP, which had ruled Delhi for ten years, won only 22 out of 70 seats in the February 5 elections, while the BJP secured a majority, ending AAP's rule in the capital. 
There is also speculation that Kejriwal may take a bigger role in Punjab politics, with discussions about him contesting the vacant Ludhiana Assembly seat. However, AAP MP Malvinder Singh Kang dismissed these reports, calling the meeting a ""routine strategy session."" 
Meanwhile, BJP leader Rohini Vijender Gupta criticized AAP, saying the party is struggling after its defeat in the Delhi elections. 
""Kejriwal is doing a meeting, but it is a sinking ship. They are trying to keep their people together...but it will not last long,"" Gupta said.

This is how BJP celebrated Delhi poll victory in Parliament,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/bjp-celebrates-delhi-poll-victory-with-modi-modi-chants-in-parliament/articleshow/118126100.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"NEW DELHI: BJP's victory in the Delhi polls was hailed by NDA members with chanting of ""Modi, Modi"" slogan in both houses of Parliament on Monday, while former Union minister Anurag Thakur took a jibe at Rahul Gandhi in Lok Sabha over Congress's dismal performance in elections in the capital over the years.
BJP members in Rajya Sabha also ridiculed AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal for having once said that PM Modi would have to be reborn to unseat AAP in Delhi. They also stated that ""people had shown the mirror to those living in Sheesh Mahal"".
Soon after Lok Sabha proceedings started, BJP MPs raised the slogan, to which Congress MPs objected. The sloganeering went on for a while before Speaker Om Birla called for the question hour.
Taking a jibe Rahul in Lok Sabha, Thakur said, ""Rahul Ji, zero check kar lijiye... (Rahul, please check the zero) as Congress has consecutively secured zero seats third time in a row. Referring to Congress' poor track record, he said, ""How many seats did people of Delhi give to Congress in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections? Zero. In 2015? Zero. In 2019? Zero. In 2020? Zero. In 2024? Zero. And in 2025? Zero.""
When proceedings of the upper house began, BJP members started sloganeering in support of PM Modi. However, sloganeering was paused for a while when Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar extended birthday greetings to BJP's Sanjay Seth. It again started, with BJP MPs chanting ""Delhi ke dil me Modi hai, Desh ke dil me Modi hai"".
Meanwhile, BJP MP from Maharashtra Medha Vishram Kulkarni, while praising the budget, referred to its impact in Delhi polls, saying, ""People showed a mirror to those living in Sheesh Mahal.""
Quoting a Hindi couplet, BJP MP Dinesh Sharma, without naming Kejriwal, said his haughtiness got a befitting answer in AAP's stinging defeat. ""The defeat came in this very birth,"" he quipped.
Meanwhile in Lok Sabha, Thakur questioned Congress leaders for not taking a holy dip during the Maha Kumbh and wondered if they had been directed not to do so by ""Uncle Soros and Uncle Sam."" Thakur said even former PM Jawaharlal Nehru took a dip in the Sangam but today's generation of the Congress is avoiding it.

Winning over Jats: How BJP scored a perfect 10 in Delhi elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/winning-over-jats-how-bjp-scored-a-perfect-10/articleshow/118126209.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"A notable win was Parvesh Verma's, which consolidated Jat youth support. Dissatisfaction with AAP's handling of rural problems and a lack of Jat representation in the INDIA bloc also contributed to BJP's success.
 
NEW DELHI: The BJP swept all 10 Jat-dominated constituencies in Delhi into its kitty, capturing territory that they did not have in the last two elections.
Party officials attributed the strong Jat support for the BJP to several factors, particularly the party's focus on addressing rural problems and its willingness to give tickets to several Jat functionaries.
A senior BJP functionary said that there were several problems in Jat-dominated areas, such as registries, a crumbling civic infrastructure, and a need for better connectivity. ""Through DDA and with the support of the lieutenant governor, some work was done. The Jats realised that central govt assistance could play a key role in their development, which was not happening,"" the BJP source said.
Days before the elections, the representatives from all 360 villages of Delhi declared their backing for BJP. Their decision stemmed from a general dissatisfaction with Delhi govt for its failure to resolve issues affecting rural communities.
Another BJP functionary said that giving a ticket to Parvesh Verma also helped, as it led to the consolidation of the community, especially the youth, in BJP's favour. 
He said the bitter political confrontation, when AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal called Verma a traitor for giving money to women through his NGO before the model code of conduct kicked in, also did not help AAP. ""When Kejriwal made personal statements targeting Parvesh Verma through his press briefings, he often made it a Jat issue as well,"" the BJP functionary said.
Also, when Verma was pitched against Kejriwal, it made the contest a battle of personalities, which led to a strong Jat backing for BJP. The BJP also swept outer Delhi seats, which were once the stronghold of his father and former chief minister Sahib Singh Verma.
Another functionary said that having senior Jat functionaries contesting the polls helped in different ways. When AAP raised the issue of Jat reservation, these functionaries were quick to respond that if the party was serious then it should have first brought the proposal in the Vidhan Sabha when it was ruling, but it never did. ""The voices got amplified,"" he said.
Paramjeet Sejwal, who lives in Lado Sarai, said: ""There were several reasons for the BJP's gain. The crumbling infrastructure when not much was happening on the development front was one. Second, people in the community saw leaders such as Kailash Gahlot leaving. Also, the INDIA bloc did not give any ticket to people from the Jat community. So, these factors started consolidating after a point.""
In Lado Sarai, which is part of the Jat-influenced seat of Mehrauli, Gajendra Yadav of BJP won by 1,786 votes. The margins in other seats were larger. In the Jat-dominated seat of Najafgarh, Neelam Pahalwan of BJP won by 29,009 votes against Tarun Kumar of AAP. Last time, AAP got 72,699 votes in this seat.
Gahlot, a former AAP govt minister who switched sides before the polls, won by 11,276 votes against Surendra Bharadwaj of AAP.
In the Palam constituency, a key seat where Jats are in significant numbers, Kuldeep Solanki of BJP won by a margin of 8,952 votes against Joginder Solanki of AAP. The AAP polled 73,094 votes in this seat.
In Nangloi Jat, Manoj Kumar Shokeen of BJP won against Raghuvinder Shokeen of AAP by a margin of 26,251 votes. The party won Narela by 8,596 votes, Rithala by 29,616, Mundka by 10,550 and Nangloi Jat by 26,251. In Vikaspuri, Matiala and Palam also , BJP got good winning margins.

The Delhi assembly's first session will begin on February 24, where MLAs will take their oath and elect a new Speaker.
""The report will be tabled in the House and many things will come to light. I think the truth will come out in the CAG report. Whether it is education, liquor, or Sheesh Mahal, many such issues will be raised in the House,"" said Khurana.
Khurana criticized AAP for not presenting the report earlier, emphasizing that the new BJP-led government would operate according to constitutional norms.
""The 8th assembly formed yesterday and its first session will begin tomorrow with the oath of the MLAs and the election of the Speaker and the next day the CAG report will be tabled. This report should have been tabled in the 7th Assembly, as per the rules. But now whatever work the Delhi government will do will be done as per the rules, as per the Constitution,"" Khurana stated.
AAP's national spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar responded by questioning BJP's commitment to their campaign promises, particularly regarding the Rs 2,500 financial assistance scheme for Delhi women.
""BJP should display optimistic politics. They should work on the promises they made to the people of Delhi instead of imposing their agenda. They said that in the first cabinet meeting, a resolution would be passed that every woman in Delhi would get Rs 2500 per month in her account,"" Kakkar said.
Kakkar pointed out that BJP had not addressed their promises in their first cabinet meeting, contrasting this with AAP's record of fulfilling their commitments when they came to power.

MSRTC workers' union said the security of bus drivers and conductors is now at stake.
On Saturday, the MSRTC cancelled 250 buses that operate between Maharashtra and Karnataka in the wake of the violence. Six of these buses operate from Pune. Abhijit Bhosle, the MSRTC public relations officer, said it is not certain whether the buses would operate on Sunday. ""We will take a call after consultation with police. At this moment, nothing can be said,"" the official told TOI. 
As the MSRTC buses towards Karnataka did not ply on Saturday, more than 20 buses from the Kolhapur Central bus stand were cancelled. Passengers were stranded at the bus stand.
Shiv Sena (UBT) workers protested against the incident at the Kolhapur Central bus stand on Saturday morning. They put up saffron flags on the Karnataka State Road Transport buses and raised slogans against the Karnataka govt. Shahupuri police detained the Shiv Sena (UBT) workers.
Vijay Dewane, the district convenor of Shiv Sena (UBT), said, ""The Maharashtra chief minister should immediately stop all the Karnataka buses from entering our state. Karnataka govt should apologise for this act, else a befitting reply will be given.""
The Maharashtra-Karnataka border dispute has been going on for several years now. Whenever the border dispute flares up, the first to bear the brunt often are the state transport buses. 
MSRTC bus conductor Prashant Thorat, who was in the bus that was attacked on Friday, said, ""Our driver, Bhaskar Jadhav, was driving the Bengaluru-Pune MSRTC bus from Chitradurga to Kolhapur when, around 9.30pm, activists of the Karnataka Navanirman Sene turned up in four to five vehicles and blocked the way. The activists, carrying red-yellow flags and scarves, the Jadhav if he could speak in Kannada. When the driver said no, he was pulled out of the bus. His face was blackened. The activists raised slogans screaming ‘If you can't speak Kannada, then you will not be allowed into Karnataka'. Black ink was also splashed on the bus. This continued for half an hour. Our bus was stranded there till 4 am and we, including all the passengers, were very scared as we didn't know the Kannada language either."" 
Repercussions of this incident are now likely to be felt in parts of Maharashtra as well. Uttam Patil, the divisional secretary of the MSRTC workers' union, said, ""There should be coordination between the two states regarding interstate traffic. The number of passengers travelling from Maharashtra to Karnataka is huge. If the corporation takes responsibility for the safety of drivers and conductors, we have no problem in going to Karnataka. MSRTC drivers and the general public are being dragged into the organisational and political tussle. The transport corporations of both states should sit together and decide on safety.""

Former Delhi CM Atishi chosen leader of opposition in Delhi assembly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/former-delhi-cm-atishi-chosen-leader-of-opposition-in-delhi-assembly/articleshow/118500913.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"Atishi (File photo)
 
NEW DELHI: The Aam Aadmi Party on Sunday named 
Atishi
 as the 
leader of opposition
 in the 
Delhi assembly
, where the 
BJP
 holds a majority with 48 MLAs.
She has become the first woman to hold this position in the assembly.
Senior 
AAP
 leader Gopal Rai announced Atishi's appointment as the leader of the opposition in the Delhi assembly during a press briefing after the AAP legislative meeting.

""In the legislative party meeting today, it has been unanimously decided that Atishi will be the leader of the opposition in the Delhi Assembly. In challenging times, Atishi has served the people of Delhi as the CM. AAP will fulfil the responsibility of a healthy opposition,"" Gopal Rai stated.
Former Delhi CM and party head 
Arvind Kejriwal
 congratulated Atishi on X: ""I congratulate Atishi ji for being elected as leader of AAP in the House. AAP will play the role of constructive opposition in the interest of people of Delhi.""
Atishi thanked Kejriwal and the party's elected MLAs for entrusting her with the responsibility.
Former Delhi CM and prominent AAP leader Atishi secured her Kalkaji seat after a tough contest against former BJP MP Ramesh Bidhuri and Congress leader Alka Lamba.
Last year in September, she was named as the Delhi CM during a meeting of AAP MLAs at Kejriwal's residence. At 43, Atishi became the youngest Delhi CM in history and was sworn-in on September 21.
Kejriwal chose to resign to test the public's faith in him and secure a fresh majority mandate for the party. However, AAP failed to continue its winning streak in the capital.
Meanwhile, the BJP took office on Thursday after the oath-taking ceremony at Ramlila Maidan, with Shalimar Bagh MLA Rekha Gupta becoming Delhi's chief minister. She is the fourth woman to hold this position in the national capital.
The BJP announced its chief ministerial face at the last moment as part of its political strategy, after considering several contenders for the role.
Along with CM Rekha Gupta, six others were appointed as ministers: Parvesh Verma, Ashish Sood, Kapil Mishra, Manjinder Singh Sirsa, Ravinder Kumar Indraj, and Pankaj Kumar Singh.
Returning to power after 27 years, the BJP defeated major AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal in New Delhi, Manish Sisodia in Jangpura, and Saurabh Bharadwaj in Greater Kailash.
The AAP dominated the 2020 and 2015 Delhi elections with landslide victories, winning 67 and 62 seats, respectively. It reduced the BJP to single digits on both occasions and prevented the Congress from securing any seats, ending the party's long 15-year reign under Sheila Dikshit.

"‘Punjab is important, not ...

NEW DELHI: Punjab minister Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal on Sunday responded to the abolition of the 'non-existent' 
department of administrative reforms
 by the 
Punjab government
, stating that the department's existence is secondary to Punjab's welfare, which remains the government's primary focus.
Speaking to news agency ANI, Dhaliwal said, “They have now abolished the department.

How to Watch IND vs PAK Champions Trophy Match in US, India and Dubai
We have all come to save Punjab. For me, the department is not important; Punjab is important. (Whether this department exists or not) is not an agenda for us”.
A notification issued on February 21 confirmed that the department, which Dhaliwal was assigned alongside 
NRI Affairs
, ""does not exist.""
“In partial modification of Punjab Government Notification No. 2/1/2022-2Cabinet/2230 dated September 23, 2024, regarding allocation of portfolios amongst the Ministers, the Department of 
Administrative Reforms
 earlier allotted to Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal, Cabinet Minister, is not in existence as on date,” the notification read.
The move triggered a response from BJP, who criticised the AAP government in Punjab, with Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri leading the charge against Dhaliwal for managing a ""non-existent"" department for 20 months.
Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri questioned how Dhaliwal had been running a department for 20 months that did not exist. “He was heading a department for 20 months which is ‘non-existent.’ Such a thing can happen only under the leadership of the AAP government,” Puri said.
BJP leader Fatehjung Singh Bajwa accused the Mann government of poor governance, saying, “Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal is one of the most senior leaders of the Cabinet and he was leading a non-existent Department, which means no meeting was ever taken… What kind of administrative reforms are being taken? People are going abroad through dunki routes, and no agent or tout who sent them was ever caught... This state government has taken Punjab back by 50 years”.
Defending his government’s move, 
Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann
 clarified that the department was merged with another to streamline governance. “We changed its name and created a new department. Earlier it was just for the name, there was no staff or office. Now, it has been created to bring reforms, whether it is in bureaucracy or other areas,” ANI quoted Mann.
Mann further explained that similar restructuring is being planned for other departments. “There are two departments – the department of administrative reforms and the one held by cabinet minister Aman Arora (governance reforms). There was confusion between the two. We have made it one proper department,” he said.
He also mentioned that other departments with overlapping functions, such as irrigation, water conservation, and drainage, may be consolidated to improve efficiency.
The department of aministrative reforms had reportedly been ‘redundant’ for some time. Officials pointed out that it existed only on paper, had no dedicated officers and no significant meetings or initiatives had taken place.
Dhaliwal, who now holds only the NRI affairs portfolio, has been in the spotlight, particularly after the US deported 
illegal migrants
 to Amritsar earlier this month. Previously, in a cabinet reshuffle in May 2023, Dhaliwal lost key portfolios such as agriculture and rural development, with administrative reforms being handed to him after the exit of Inderbir Singh Nijjar.
However, its role remained unclear as the state’s good governance and IT departments were already handling administrative efficiency improvements.

Speaking about the move, deputy CM Sharma expressed that prisoners also have the desire to partake in the sacred tradition of

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi will travel to Mauritius next month as chief guest for the national day celebrations of the Indian Ocean country. After 2015, this is the second time Modi has been given that honour by Mauritius.
The announcement about Modi's participation as the guest of honour on the 57th anniversary of the independence of Mauritius on March 12 was made by PM Navinchandra Ramgoolam in Parliament on Friday.
""It is indeed a singular privilege for our country to host such a distinguished personality, who is doing us this honour in spite of his very tight schedule and in spite of his recent visits to Paris and the United States. He has agreed to be here as our special guest. The visit of Modi is a testimony of the close relations between our two nations,"" said Ramgoolam.
President Droupadi Murmu attended 
Mauritius National Day celebrations
 last year as the chief guest. With 70% of its people tracing their roots to India, Mauritius is a key partner for India in the western Indian Ocean.
India last year strongly backed the agreement between the United Kingdom and Mauritius for the return of Mauritian sovereignty over the Chagos archipelago, including Diego Garcia, saying it completed the decolonisation of Mauritius. India has consistently supported Mauritius's claim for sovereignty over Chagos, in line with its long-held position on decolonization and support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations, as well as its longstanding and close partnership with Mauritius.

The conductor had an argument with the college student when she insisted that he speak to her in Marathi, after he demanded that her male companion buy a ticket for the ride. Later, around 20 people boarded the bus at Balekundri and beat up the driver and conductor. 
Kannada outfits that had already expressed their ire over the attack on the crew, raised the pitch several notches higher on Saturday.
Condemning the incident and registering of a case against the conductor under the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, activists of Karnataka Nava Nirmana Sene blackened the face of a 
Maharashtra bus conductor
 and the front windshield of a bus in Chitradurga on Saturday. Meanwhile, 
Karnataka Rakshana Vedike
 activists protested outside Marihal police station and at Channamma Circle.
Police have arrested four persons so far, including a minor, in connection with the assault. While three of them were remanded in judicial custody for 14 days, the minor was sent to a remand home on Friday night. 
The incident led to disruption in bus services between Karnataka and Maharashtra, with Kannada outfits in Karnataka and Shiv Sena activists on the Maharashtra side of the border protesting.
Police commissioner Iada Martin Marbaniang said: ""Three teams have been formed to search for the remaining accused. The victim was a minor girl, and a complaint was filed on her behalf under Section 12 of the Pocso Act against the conductor.""
Police said precautionary measures have been taken to maintain law and order, and SPs along the Karnataka-Maharashtra border will be told to share information about the steps to be taken to prevent any untoward incident.

Protesters in Manipur valley districts after police arrest village volunteers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/protesters-in-manipur-valley-districts-after-police-arrest-village-volunteers/articleshow/118446491.cms,Manipur,General News,"NEW DELHI: Imphal valley in Manipur once again became the epicentre of protests as demonstrators blocked roads and set tires on fire, retaliating to the arrest of several village volunteers in Kakching district.
In an early morning operation in Panjao Pallumda, security forces detained more than ten volunteers, transferring them to a camp in Phundrei, Thoubal district, news agency PTI reported, quoting officials.
Protests spread across multiple districts, including Imphal East, Imphal West, Thoubal, and Kakching. Demonstrators forced the closure of markets and roadside shops in several areas of Imphal, including Wangkhei, Uripok, Thangmeiband, and Khurai.
The unrest erupted just a day after governor Ajay Kumar Bhalla urged residents to surrender looted and illegally held weapons within seven days, warning of ""strict action"" if the deadline was ignored.
Meanwhile, security forces have intensified their crackdown on insurgent groups, arresting 17 militants from various banned outfits in the last 24 hours, police said on Friday.

"From Mumbai to Kolkata, these Indian territories at risk when asteroid strikes earth in 2032",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-mumbai-to-kolkata-these-indian-territories-at-risk-when-asteroid-strikes-earth-in-2032/articleshow/118440095.cms,Maharashtra,Mumbai,"Representational image
 
An asteroid that is likely to hit Earth in the year 2032 has major Indian cities at risk according to the assessment by astronomers.
Asteroid 2024 YR4, 130 to 300 feet long, is expected to make a very close pass of the planet in 2032. Although much of the object’s estimated track passes over an empty ocean, it includes mega Indian cities Mumbai and Kolkata. 
Based on the trajectory, towns in the state of Maharashtra, Northern Telangana, Southern Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Odisha, Jharkhand, and West Bengal are also at risk. The impact, however, depends on several factors like entry angle, speed, and atmospheric effects.
.
Other probable impact locations in the world include Bogotá, Colombia; Lagos and Nigeria.
Although the asteroid is not large, especially when compared to a much larger asteroid Apophis discovered in 2004, its potential impact is nevertheless capable of creating extensive destruction. 
Nasa
, however, has lowered the probability of the asteroid striking the Earth to 1.5%.
The speed of the asteroid will be approximately 40,000 miles per hour, which will generate an energy outflow 500 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb, and the explosion could very well annihilate a whole city.
NASA’s New Update RevealsThe Truth About Asteroid 2024 YR4
The kinetic energy of an asteroid is a proxy for how destructive its impact would be. And as asteroids mostly move at the same speed — about 38,000 mph — the key variable is its mass. The composition is also important. 2024 YR4 is statistically likelier to be a stony asteroid, which is more prone to fragment into smaller pieces as it is heated during its atmospheric descent.
While the thought of an asteroid hitting Earth is undoubtedly unsettling, the probability of 2024 YR4 making contact in 2032 is extremely low. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are closely monitoring the asteroid’s path.
The asteroid was initially discovered on December 27, 2023, by Chilean El Sauce Observatory, 2024 YR4.

"'Congress and AAP never addressed issues of people of Delhi,' says CM Rekha Gupta",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-and-aap-never-addressed-issues-of-people-of-delhi-says-cm-rekha-gupta/articleshow/118443405.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"Delhi CM Rekha Gupta
 
NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister 
Rekha Gupta
 on Friday criticised the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party for failing to address the issues of Delhi residents during their respective tenures, specifying that her government approved the 
Ayushman Bharat scheme
 on its first day in office.
Gupta, who was sworn-in on Thursday along with six other ministers, marked the BJP's return to power in the capital after more than 26 years.
Accusing the Congress and AAP of neglecting the people of Delhi, Gupta said, ""Congress ruled Delhi for 15 years and after that it was the AAP... yet, they never addressed the issues of the people of Delhi. And now, just one day after we took office, they have started questioning our government.""
Highlighting her party's swift action, she mentioned, “We approved the Ayushman Bharat 
health insurance scheme
 in our first cabinet meeting—a scheme AAP stalled for years. We took oath and immediately fulfilled this promise.” 
Gupta suggested that Congress and AAP should focus on their internal matters, stating, “Many of their members are ready to leave, and they are worried because we are committed to fulfilling all our promises.” 
She also claimed that the opposition feared her government’s transparency. “They are scared because we will present reports in the first assembly session that were never submitted before. The truth about their actions will be revealed to the people,” she said. 
Reaffirming her commitment to the public, Gupta assured that her government would keep all its promises. “We started our work on day one by visiting Yamuna Ghat, and we are determined to fulfill 100 percent of our commitments,” she added.

'Rise above political differences': Dharmendra Pradhan hits back at Stalin on NEP row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rise-above-political-differences-dharmendra-pradhan-hits-back-at-stalin-on-nep-row/articleshow/118442782.cms,Madhya Pradesh,Dhar,"MK Stalin and Dharmendra Pradhan (File photo)
 
NEW DELHI: In response to 
MK Stalin
's letter to Prime Minister 
Narendra Modi
, Union minister and BJP leader 
Dharmendra Pradhan
 on Friday wrote to the Tamil Nadu CM, clarifying that the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 does not mandate any language.
He targeted the Tamil Nadu CM for interpreting 
NEP 2020
 with a ""myopic vision"" and for portraying progressive educational reforms as political threats. Pradhan also stated that the chief minister's letter to PM contradicted the spirit of cooperative federalism.
Pradhan urged the Tamil Nadu government to ""rise above political differences for the interest of young learners."" He also added, ""By not implementing NEP 2020, we are depriving our students, teachers, and parents of global and pan-India opportunities. Rejecting a student-centric, future-focused policy is really regressive. Education should not be politicized. Misrepresented facts won’t solve anything. Even many non-BJP states are implementing NEP, taking full cooperation from the federal government. Tamil Nadu is losing out on Rs 5,000 crore by not implementing PM Shri Schools, which focus on scientific education and teaching methods in the Tamil language."" 
Earlier today, on International Mother Language Day, CM Stalin posted on X, saying, “We should protect our mother tongues from our foes. Tamil is our virtue. Tamil is our protection.”
In his letter to the Prime Minister on Thursday, Stalin expressed concerns over Union education minister Pradhan's statement that Tamil Nadu's 'Samagra Shiksha' funds would not be released unless the state implements the 'three-language' policy outlined in NEP 2020.
Meanwhile, BJP's Tamil Nadu chief Annamalai supported the 
three-language policy
, saying that learning a third language is beneficial for Tamil Nadu. He also accused the DMK and its allies of misleading the public by claiming that Hindi would be mandatory under the new education policy. 
On Tuesday, deputy CM Udhayanidhi Stalin argued that “Hindi will destroy Tamil like it did many North Indian languages.” 
The INDIA bloc parties united to protest against the BJP-led central government, accusing it of encroaching on state rights, denying funds in the Union Budget, and withholding educational funds for Tamil Nadu.
""Hindi destroyed the local languages of states in the north such as Rajasthani, Haryanvi, Bhojpuri, and other Bihari languages and has become the primary local language. The same will happen if Hindi is implemented in Tamil Nadu too. Almost 99% of Tamils who are now working abroad and in prestigious organisations such as Isro were from govt schools who did not study Hindi,"" Udhayanidhi said at the protest.

'Congress B team of BJP in Delhi polls': Mayawati renews attack on Rahul Gandhi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-b-team-of-bjp-in-delhi-polls-mayawati-renews-attack-on-rahul-gandhi/articleshow/118440852.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"Mayawati and Rahul Gandhi (File photo)
 
NEW DELHI: Continuing her verbal battle with Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi, Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati on Friday accused Congress of acting as BJP's ""B team"" in the recent Delhi assembly elections, contributing to BJP's victory.
In a post on X, Mayawati said, ""It is a common discussion that this time Congress contested the Delhi Assembly elections as BJP's B team, due to which BJP has come to power here. Otherwise, Congress' condition would not have been so bad in this election that this party could not even save the deposit of most of its candidates.""
Mayawati also took a jab at Rahul Gandhi, advising him to introspect rather than blame others. She said, ""It would be better if Rahul Gandhi looks into himself before pointing fingers at others, especially at the BSP chief. This is my advice to him""
The BSP supremo also warned the newly formed BJP government in Delhi to fulfill its electoral promises, cautioning that failure could result in a fate similar to Congress's decline. 
""The new BJP government formed in Delhi has the challenge of fulfilling all the promises made during the elections, especially those related to public welfare and development, on time, otherwise, the condition of this party may also become as bad as that of Congress in the future,"" Mayawati's post on X read.
In the Delhi elections held on February 5, the BJP secured a strong majority with 48 seats, ending AAP's decade-long rule and leaving Congress with no seats. 
Earlier on Thursday, Rahul Gandhi questioned Mayawati's electoral strategy, asking, ""Why doesn't Mayawati fight elections properly?"" He added, ""We wanted Behenji to join us in the fight against BJP."" 
Expressing his disappointment, Gandhi said, ""For some reason, Mayawati Ji isn't contesting, which disappoints us greatly. If all three parties came together, the BJP would never win."" He also noted that the doors of the INDIA alliance remain open for her.
Mayawati countered, accusing Congress of ""double standards"". She claimed Congress displays ""animosity and casteist attitude"" towards BSP where it's strong but talks of alliance where it's weak, like in Uttar Pradesh.
Mayawati asserted that BSP has suffered in past alliances with Congress as its vote base didn’t transfer to BSP, leading to electoral losses.

NEW DELHI: The Congress in Punjab plans to bring in at least 60-70 new faces as MLA candidates for the 2027 Vidhan Sabha elections, state unit chief 
Amrinder Singh Raja Warring
 announced Thursday. Speaking at the Punjab Youth Congress' state executive meeting, Warring highlighted the party's focus on rejuvenating political leadership and aligning with aspirations of Punjab's people.
""The Punjab Congress is committed to ensuring that dynamic and committed leaders, who understand the state's needs, represent the people,"" Warring said.
He added, ""these new faces will not only symbolise change but also embody the trust and hopes of the youth and the common people of Punjab.""
Warring encouraged youth Congress members to approach this opportunity with dedication, emphasising their role in building a stronger and more inclusive Punjab. ""This is your chance to prove yourself and show the people of Punjab that we are committed to real and meaningful change,"" he said. 
The Congress leader stressed the importance of discipline and collective efforts within the party, urging young leaders to address public concerns and defend their rights. With just two years until the next elections, he called for focused efforts to strengthen the party's presence in the state. 
Indian Youth Congress
 (IYC) president Uday Bhanu Chib also rallied volunteers to prepare for the 2027 polls, aiming to oust the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) from power in Punjab. Chib described the Youth Congress as the party’s backbone and praised its frontline role in political battles. 
Chib mentioned that the Congress had regained strength in Punjab during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections by securing seven seats and expressed confidence that the public is ready to return the party to power. 
Meanwhile, following the BJP's win over AAP in Delhi, political focus has shifted to Punjab—AAP's last remaining stronghold. Rival parties, including the BJP and Congress, are gearing up for the upcoming battle in Punjab, strategising for electoral gains. 
The BJP, fresh off its return to power in Delhi after 27 years, has extended a ministry ticket to Sikh leader Manjinder Sirsa, a move widely seen as an effort to strengthen the party's appeal in Punjab.

Apart from two years' RI for each of the five offences relating to cheating and forgery under the IPC (all sentences to run concurrently), additional chief judicial magistrate Rupali Narwadiya imposed a Rs 10,000 fine for each of the five offences; the amount comes to Rs 50,000 each. The court also directed Mhada and the 
Nashik deputy collector
 (urban land ceiling) to take measures to cancel allotment of the flats after the appeals period was over.
On a plea moved later, the court granted bail to the NCP functionary and his brother to enable them to appeal against their conviction before a sessions court in Nashik. Under the Representation of the People Act, a legislator attracts disqualification if convicted for two years or more, unless the conviction is stayed.
Kokate is the second minister of Ajit Pawar's NCP to face the heat after Dhananjay Munde, who is under attack in the murder case of Massajog sarpanch in Beed district.
Kokate, who was in court, later told reporters, ""It's a 30-year-old politically motivated case. Then MLA and former minister Tukaram Dighole raised the matter, and a police complaint was registered against me by a govt official. I haven't yet read the judgment but we will certainly file an appeal.""
The court said, ""The accused no.1 at the time of the alleged incident was having post in a political party... also, he is an advocate and now he is a minister in agriculture department... therefore such approach of accused no.1 for getting the flats at a low rate by concealing information regarding his income is highly dreadful (sic).""

"After drubbing AAP in Delhi, 'Bangal cholo' next for BJP?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-drubbing-aap-in-delhi-bangla-chalo-next-for-bjp/articleshow/118116026.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"PTI photo (File)
 
NEW DELHI: Since 2014, the BJP has been moving from one poll victory to another -- both on the national as well as the state level -- with seemingly nothing able to stand in the way of the Modi wave. 
However, one thorn in BJP's side was Delhi, where the Arvind Kejriwal-led fortress managed to survive the saffron tsunami not once, but twice.
However, 2025 proved to be a breakthrough year as the BJP broke the 27-year-old jinx to storm back to power in the Capital. It defeated the indomitable Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) by winning 48 seats in the 70-member Delhi assembly.
Bristling with confidence after acquiring the Rajdhani in the North, the party has already given clear indications that its next mission is to make inroads in the eastern state of West Bengal.
Like Delhi, making inroads in the Mamata Banerjee-ruled Bengal has been an uphill task for the BJP for the past two assembly elections.
In the 2016 assembly elections, buoyed by the majority mandate at the Centre, the BJP expected to emerge as a key party but faced an embarrassing defeat. The party won only 3 seats in the 294-seat West Bengal assembly.
In 2019, the BJP came back to power at the Centre with an even bigger mandate and by then had a decent presence in even the northeastern states, where BJP had negligible presence before 2014.
Two years down the line, the party made another attempt to breach the fortress of Mamata Banerjee but to no avail. 
In 2021, when the results trickled in, the BJP won only 77 seats with TMC winning a whopping mandate by securing victory on 215 seats. Though the BJP vote and seat share improved substantially, it was far less than the 200-seat mark the party had expected to win in the polls.
Just like Delhi in 2015 and 2020, the BJP fell flat in Bengal in 2016 and 2021.
However, with the BJP finally triumphing in Delhi, Bengal BJP leaders now see the possibility that Bengal may not be ""mission impossible"" anymore.
As BJP was celebrating its victory in the Capital on February 8, its top Bengal leader Suvendu Adhikari shot off a salvo at CM Mamata Banerjee, saying after the national capital, Bengal would vote for the BJP by uprooting ruling TMC.
""Delhi ki jeet hamari hai ... 2026 mein Bengal ki baari hai … (Delhi's victory is ours ... in 2026 it will be Bengal's turn),"" Adhikari said while reacting to BJP's massive comeback after 27 years of political exile.
Pumped by the BJP's historic win in Delhi, Bengal BJP chief and Union minister Sukanta Majumdar said Delhi's victory would serve as a morale booster for party workers in West Bengal ahead of next year's assembly elections.
BJP's Amit Malviya, who heads the party's I-T department, said that ""jitters from the Delhi results are being felt in West Bengal"" and claimed that ""nervous"" Mamata Banerjee would go solo in next year's assembly polls.
""A nervous Mamata Banerjee has told TMC MLAs that there will be NO alliance in Bengal … It is not surprising that she applies a different yardstick to the opposition in Haryana and Delhi but is unwilling to cede space for the alliance at home,"" Malviya wrote on X.

"No discontent in Punjab AAP, asserts Bhagwant Mann; all MLAs attend Delhi meet",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-discontent-in-punjab-aap-asserts-bhagwant-mann-all-mlas-attend-delhi-meet/articleshow/118157908.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"NEW DELHI: Punjab CM 
Bhagwant Mann
 on Tuesday dismissed claims by Congress and BJP of unrest brewing among AAP MLAs, tamping down speculation that the ripples from AAP's Delhi debacle may pose a risk to his govt.
Talking to reporters after the surprise move of party boss Arvind Kejriwal to summon Punjab CM, ministers, MPs and MLAs to Delhi, Mann took on Congress and said ""switching sides is Congress's culture"" and reminded Partap Singh Bajwa, the leader of opposition in Punjab, that his party drew a blank in Delhi.
Ahead of the meeting, which AAP said was attended by all 92 Punjab MLAs, Bajwa had alleged that the party was preparing the ground to oust Mann from the CM's post. He had also claimed that over 30 AAP MLAs were in touch with his party. 
Meeting sparks speculation about instability in 
Punjab AAP
 Instead of counting our MLAs, he should see how many Congress candidates won in Delhi,"" Bhagwant Mann said. Kejriwal and other senior functionaries held a meeting with Punjab functionaries to ostensibly thank them for their involvement in Delhi campaign.
According to AAP, the meeting at Kapurthala House saw all MLAs from Punjab and MPs from the state come together in what the party projected as a show of solidarity and normalcy amid the gloom of the Delhi loss. Besides Kejriwal and former deputy CM Manish Sisodia, national organisational secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Sandeep Pathak and RS MP Raghav Chadha were present.
Kejriwal is learnt to have asked the Punjab MLAs to reconnect with voters while working unitedly to pave the way for AAP's return to office in 2027. The timing of the meeting following AAP's defeat in Delhi had sparked speculation about instability in the party's Punjab unit. Asked about Bajwa's allegation that he could quit AAP with a group of MLAs, Mann said, ""Let them say so. We cultivated the party with hard work by going to every nook and corner of the state. They don't worry about their own party and find fault with others. It is Congress that has a culture of switching parties.""
BJP's newly-elected Rajouri Garden MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa claimed Mann's ""nervousness and body language"" after the meeting ""supports the conspiracy theory"" that he had spoken of on Monday. Sirsa had alleged that Kejriwal was scripting a narrative to oust Mann. 
AAP's estranged RS MP Swati Maliwal also took a dig at Kejriwal and said, ""Some people have started treating Punjab as their personal ATM. Today, massive corruption is rampant in Punjab.""

NEW DELHI: Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann on Tuesday responded to Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa's claim that 30 Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs were in contact with him. 
""Pratap Singh Bajwa has been saying this for almost three years. Let him say whatever he wants. I would ask Pratap Singh Bajwa to count how many MLAs they (Congress) have in Delhi,"" Mann told reporters. 
Mann also said, ""He (Bajwa) has been making claims earlier also that 20 MLAs or 40 MLAs are in touch with him. Let them say it. We have formed this party with our sweat and blood, going among people in villages and towns in the state.""
Poll
Do you agree with the claim made by Congress?
No, it's just political talk
Yes, it seems likely
After AAP's loss in the Delhi assembly elections, Bajwa claimed that an internal struggle would start between Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann and AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal. He also said that over 30 AAP MLAs were in contact with the Congress and were ready to switch sides. 
Congress MP Pramod Tiwari, however, denied that AAP MLAs were in touch with either the BJP or Congress. He said Congress does not support breaking other parties but is observing the political situation in Punjab. 
""BJP has a history of horse-trading and breaking parties—we have seen this in Maharashtra, Goa, Manipur also. They will try to do this in Punjab as well. As far as Congress is concerned, we do not believe in breaking parties. Our party's state leadership is monitoring the situation over there,"" Tiwari said while talking to news agency ANI. 
Earlier in the day, Mann arrived at Kapurthala House in New Delhi for a meeting with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal amid reports of differences within AAP. 
""Our MLAs reached here, and we had a meeting with party national convenor Arvind Kejriwal. He thanked them all for campaigning during the Delhi Assembly elections. Our government in Punjab has always worked for public welfare, whether in education or infrastructure. We need to speed up… Winning and losing is a part of the game. People of Delhi still remember us as someone who worked for them. We have two years more in Punjab. We will make Punjab a good model,"" Mann told the media. 
AAP, which had ruled Delhi for ten years, won only 22 out of 70 seats in the February 5 elections, while the BJP secured a majority, ending AAP's rule in the capital. 
There is also speculation that Kejriwal may take a bigger role in Punjab politics, with discussions about him contesting the vacant Ludhiana Assembly seat. However, AAP MP Malvinder Singh Kang dismissed these reports, calling the meeting a ""routine strategy session."" 
Meanwhile, BJP leader Rohini Vijender Gupta criticized AAP, saying the party is struggling after its defeat in the Delhi elections. 
""Kejriwal is doing a meeting, but it is a sinking ship. They are trying to keep their people together...but it will not last long,"" Gupta said.

This is how BJP celebrated Delhi poll victory in Parliament,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/bjp-celebrates-delhi-poll-victory-with-modi-modi-chants-in-parliament/articleshow/118126100.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"NEW DELHI: BJP's victory in the Delhi polls was hailed by NDA members with chanting of ""Modi, Modi"" slogan in both houses of Parliament on Monday, while former Union minister Anurag Thakur took a jibe at Rahul Gandhi in Lok Sabha over Congress's dismal performance in elections in the capital over the years.
BJP members in Rajya Sabha also ridiculed AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal for having once said that PM Modi would have to be reborn to unseat AAP in Delhi. They also stated that ""people had shown the mirror to those living in Sheesh Mahal"".
Soon after Lok Sabha proceedings started, BJP MPs raised the slogan, to which Congress MPs objected. The sloganeering went on for a while before Speaker Om Birla called for the question hour.
Taking a jibe Rahul in Lok Sabha, Thakur said, ""Rahul Ji, zero check kar lijiye... (Rahul, please check the zero) as Congress has consecutively secured zero seats third time in a row. Referring to Congress' poor track record, he said, ""How many seats did people of Delhi give to Congress in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections? Zero. In 2015? Zero. In 2019? Zero. In 2020? Zero. In 2024? Zero. And in 2025? Zero.""
When proceedings of the upper house began, BJP members started sloganeering in support of PM Modi. However, sloganeering was paused for a while when Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar extended birthday greetings to BJP's Sanjay Seth. It again started, with BJP MPs chanting ""Delhi ke dil me Modi hai, Desh ke dil me Modi hai"".
Meanwhile, BJP MP from Maharashtra Medha Vishram Kulkarni, while praising the budget, referred to its impact in Delhi polls, saying, ""People showed a mirror to those living in Sheesh Mahal.""
Quoting a Hindi couplet, BJP MP Dinesh Sharma, without naming Kejriwal, said his haughtiness got a befitting answer in AAP's stinging defeat. ""The defeat came in this very birth,"" he quipped.
Meanwhile in Lok Sabha, Thakur questioned Congress leaders for not taking a holy dip during the Maha Kumbh and wondered if they had been directed not to do so by ""Uncle Soros and Uncle Sam."" Thakur said even former PM Jawaharlal Nehru took a dip in the Sangam but today's generation of the Congress is avoiding it.

Winning over Jats: How BJP scored a perfect 10 in Delhi elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/winning-over-jats-how-bjp-scored-a-perfect-10/articleshow/118126209.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"A notable win was Parvesh Verma's, which consolidated Jat youth support. Dissatisfaction with AAP's handling of rural problems and a lack of Jat representation in the INDIA bloc also contributed to BJP's success.
 
NEW DELHI: The BJP swept all 10 Jat-dominated constituencies in Delhi into its kitty, capturing territory that they did not have in the last two elections.
Party officials attributed the strong Jat support for the BJP to several factors, particularly the party's focus on addressing rural problems and its willingness to give tickets to several Jat functionaries.
A senior BJP functionary said that there were several problems in Jat-dominated areas, such as registries, a crumbling civic infrastructure, and a need for better connectivity. ""Through DDA and with the support of the lieutenant governor, some work was done. The Jats realised that central govt assistance could play a key role in their development, which was not happening,"" the BJP source said.
Days before the elections, the representatives from all 360 villages of Delhi declared their backing for BJP. Their decision stemmed from a general dissatisfaction with Delhi govt for its failure to resolve issues affecting rural communities.
Another BJP functionary said that giving a ticket to Parvesh Verma also helped, as it led to the consolidation of the community, especially the youth, in BJP's favour. 
He said the bitter political confrontation, when AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal called Verma a traitor for giving money to women through his NGO before the model code of conduct kicked in, also did not help AAP. ""When Kejriwal made personal statements targeting Parvesh Verma through his press briefings, he often made it a Jat issue as well,"" the BJP functionary said.
Also, when Verma was pitched against Kejriwal, it made the contest a battle of personalities, which led to a strong Jat backing for BJP. The BJP also swept outer Delhi seats, which were once the stronghold of his father and former chief minister Sahib Singh Verma.
Another functionary said that having senior Jat functionaries contesting the polls helped in different ways. When AAP raised the issue of Jat reservation, these functionaries were quick to respond that if the party was serious then it should have first brought the proposal in the Vidhan Sabha when it was ruling, but it never did. ""The voices got amplified,"" he said.
Paramjeet Sejwal, who lives in Lado Sarai, said: ""There were several reasons for the BJP's gain. The crumbling infrastructure when not much was happening on the development front was one. Second, people in the community saw leaders such as Kailash Gahlot leaving. Also, the INDIA bloc did not give any ticket to people from the Jat community. So, these factors started consolidating after a point.""
In Lado Sarai, which is part of the Jat-influenced seat of Mehrauli, Gajendra Yadav of BJP won by 1,786 votes. The margins in other seats were larger. In the Jat-dominated seat of Najafgarh, Neelam Pahalwan of BJP won by 29,009 votes against Tarun Kumar of AAP. Last time, AAP got 72,699 votes in this seat.
Gahlot, a former AAP govt minister who switched sides before the polls, won by 11,276 votes against Surendra Bharadwaj of AAP.
In the Palam constituency, a key seat where Jats are in significant numbers, Kuldeep Solanki of BJP won by a margin of 8,952 votes against Joginder Solanki of AAP. The AAP polled 73,094 votes in this seat.
In Nangloi Jat, Manoj Kumar Shokeen of BJP won against Raghuvinder Shokeen of AAP by a margin of 26,251 votes. The party won Narela by 8,596 votes, Rithala by 29,616, Mundka by 10,550 and Nangloi Jat by 26,251. In Vikaspuri, Matiala and Palam also , BJP got good winning margins.

The Delhi assembly's first session will begin on February 24, where MLAs will take their oath and elect a new Speaker.
""The report will be tabled in the House and many things will come to light. I think the truth will come out in the CAG report. Whether it is education, liquor, or Sheesh Mahal, many such issues will be raised in the House,"" said Khurana.
Khurana criticized AAP for not presenting the report earlier, emphasizing that the new BJP-led government would operate according to constitutional norms.
""The 8th assembly formed yesterday and its first session will begin tomorrow with the oath of the MLAs and the election of the Speaker and the next day the CAG report will be tabled. This report should have been tabled in the 7th Assembly, as per the rules. But now whatever work the Delhi government will do will be done as per the rules, as per the Constitution,"" Khurana stated.
AAP's national spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar responded by questioning BJP's commitment to their campaign promises, particularly regarding the Rs 2,500 financial assistance scheme for Delhi women.
""BJP should display optimistic politics. They should work on the promises they made to the people of Delhi instead of imposing their agenda. They said that in the first cabinet meeting, a resolution would be passed that every woman in Delhi would get Rs 2500 per month in her account,"" Kakkar said.
Kakkar pointed out that BJP had not addressed their promises in their first cabinet meeting, contrasting this with AAP's record of fulfilling their commitments when they came to power.

MSRTC workers' union said the security of bus drivers and conductors is now at stake.
On Saturday, the MSRTC cancelled 250 buses that operate between Maharashtra and Karnataka in the wake of the violence. Six of these buses operate from Pune. Abhijit Bhosle, the MSRTC public relations officer, said it is not certain whether the buses would operate on Sunday. ""We will take a call after consultation with police. At this moment, nothing can be said,"" the official told TOI. 
As the MSRTC buses towards Karnataka did not ply on Saturday, more than 20 buses from the Kolhapur Central bus stand were cancelled. Passengers were stranded at the bus stand.
Shiv Sena (UBT) workers protested against the incident at the Kolhapur Central bus stand on Saturday morning. They put up saffron flags on the Karnataka State Road Transport buses and raised slogans against the Karnataka govt. Shahupuri police detained the Shiv Sena (UBT) workers.
Vijay Dewane, the district convenor of Shiv Sena (UBT), said, ""The Maharashtra chief minister should immediately stop all the Karnataka buses from entering our state. Karnataka govt should apologise for this act, else a befitting reply will be given.""
The Maharashtra-Karnataka border dispute has been going on for several years now. Whenever the border dispute flares up, the first to bear the brunt often are the state transport buses. 
MSRTC bus conductor Prashant Thorat, who was in the bus that was attacked on Friday, said, ""Our driver, Bhaskar Jadhav, was driving the Bengaluru-Pune MSRTC bus from Chitradurga to Kolhapur when, around 9.30pm, activists of the Karnataka Navanirman Sene turned up in four to five vehicles and blocked the way. The activists, carrying red-yellow flags and scarves, the Jadhav if he could speak in Kannada. When the driver said no, he was pulled out of the bus. His face was blackened. The activists raised slogans screaming ‘If you can't speak Kannada, then you will not be allowed into Karnataka'. Black ink was also splashed on the bus. This continued for half an hour. Our bus was stranded there till 4 am and we, including all the passengers, were very scared as we didn't know the Kannada language either."" 
Repercussions of this incident are now likely to be felt in parts of Maharashtra as well. Uttam Patil, the divisional secretary of the MSRTC workers' union, said, ""There should be coordination between the two states regarding interstate traffic. The number of passengers travelling from Maharashtra to Karnataka is huge. If the corporation takes responsibility for the safety of drivers and conductors, we have no problem in going to Karnataka. MSRTC drivers and the general public are being dragged into the organisational and political tussle. The transport corporations of both states should sit together and decide on safety.""

NEW DELHI: Newly sworn-in Delhi ministers spent the day on Saturday doing a reality check on the ground by carrying surprise inspections and asking officials to fast-track projects that have been delayed or are stuck.
PWD minister Parvesh Verma undertook an extensive review of projects in and around Mathura Road and Ring Road, zeroing in on the work on Barapullah flyover's extension, which has got inordinately delayed.
""I was told that no minister had visited the project for a decade and no one even cared to get it completed even as the city is grappling with traffic jams,"" he said, adding that all this only made the city air more polluted.
""If you delay a project, it also leads to cost escalation. The AAP govt didn't care about these things. I have asked for details of whatever clearances they need, and I will personally ensure that there are no further hindrances,"" he said. ""The road will be opened to the public in the next 12 months. Money is not an issue.""
Ensure timely completion of works: Verma 
 Explaining what plagues Delhi roads, Verma said these were repeatedly dug up by various agencies for laying underground cables or for other work. ""This is not the way to operate. We will have a nodal agency that will ensure all underground work is completed before a road is constructed so that the taxpayers' money is not wasted,"" Verma said. He emphasised the need for better coordination to prevent wastage of funds.
Verma also reviewed the progress in construction of the Bhairon Marg underpass, part of the Pragati Maidan tunnel, and the Sarai Kale Khan stretch. He directed officials to ensure timely completion of all work. Emphasising the importance of quality construction, he said, ""We should build a road that lasts for 10-15 years. Though the official lifespan is five years, the quality should be such that it remains in good condition for at least 10-15 years.""
He also inspected the Moolchand underpass, which has in the past witnessed severe waterlogging. To address this long-standing issue, he reviewed the upgradation of facilities with Japanese pumps being installed to make the drainage more effective.
""I have directed officials to take all necessary measures before the rainy season to ensure that water does not accumulate. Proper drainage systems should be created and maintained, and pumps should be installed in time,"" he said.
Verma said these efforts were in line with PM Modi's vision of a cleaner, greener and more developed Delhi. ""We are committed to transforming Delhi into a world-class city with better roads, effective drainage systems and overall beautification,"" he added.
Education minister Ashish Sood visited Janakpuri and expressed his dismay over the accumulation of garbage. ""It has been lying scattered over a 1km stretch over the past two and a half years. This is unacceptable. People are hassled about AAP councillors. We are committed to cleaning this up,"" he said.
Health minister Pankaj Kumar Singh visited 
Rao Tula Ram Memorial Hospital
 in Jaffarpur Kalan along with BJP MP Kamaljeet Sehrawat. ""The conditions here are quite bad. There is a lack of doctors. A building that should have been made before 2020 is incomplete. We have decided with Sehrawat that in 3 months, we will transform this hospital,"" he said. ""We will come back here after three months to show you how well this hospital is functioning.""
On the mohalla clinics, he said: ""There are many clinics that do not have doctors or medicines. They were leased out by MLAs in the name of clinics. If these complaints are true, the matter will be investigated,"" he said.

8 workers trapped as roof of Telangana tunnel caves in,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/8-workers-trapped-as-roof-of-telangana-tunnel-caves-in/articleshow/118490342.cms,Telangana,General News,"NDRF personnel assist in rescue operations after a portion of the Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) tunnel near Domalpenta collapsed, in Nagarkurnool on Saturday. (Pic credit: ANI)
 
HYDERABAD: Eight people were trapped inside when a portion of the tunnel roof at 
Srisailam Left Bank Canal
 (SLBC) collapsed on Saturday morning near Domalpenta in Telangana's Nagarku-nool district.
Sources said 60 workers were on site when the roof suddenly caved in by about 200 metres inside the tunnel, which has a depth of 500 ft. While 52 of them managed to come out to safety, with some of them taken to hospital with injuries, eight workers remained trapped deep inside the tunnel.
These included 
Jaiprakash Associates
 Limited project engineer Manoj Kumar and field engineer Sri Niwas, both from Uttar Pradesh, four labourers from Jharkhand - Sandeep Sahu, Jataks, Santosh Sahu and Anuj Sahu - and two machine operators of Robbins India Company - Sunny Singh from J&K and Gurpreet Singh from Punjab.
According to sources, no communication had been established with the trapped people till reports last came in. Noises of shifting of boulders were heard till evening, indicating that the roof in collapsed areas was still unstable, the sources said.
PM Narendra Modi dialled chief minister A Revanth Reddy to inquire about the mishap and assured all possible assistance from the Centre, including deployment of 
National Disaster Response Force
 (NDRF) personnel, for the ongoing rescue operation.
According to senior irrigation officials, the tunnel roof collapsed due to a sudden leakage of water and soil, covering nearly 13 km of the excavation site. The SLBC tunnel is about 44 km long from the Srisailam dam's left bank. 
The accident occurred about 13 km from the mouth of the tunnel. An earth fracture on the side of the tunnel wall caused the water and mud to gush in, forcing the workers to scramble to safety.
Jaiprakash Associates and Robbins India, responsible for tunnel boring, said the accident took place within 30 minutes of taking up the work at 8 am. Those positioned near the tunnel boring machine managed to escape, while workers in the front section of the tunnel got trapped, representatives of the companies said. The works were immediately halted, and supervisors quickly evacuated as many workers as possible. 
Officials said the ventilation system inside the tunnel remained functional, ensuring oxygen supply to the trapped workers. The Army teams are expected to arrive at the site by Saturday night.

Delhi govt to table CAG reports on February 25; Arvinder Singh Lovely appointed as pro tem speaker,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-govt-to-table-cag-reports-on-february-25/articleshow/118479158.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"In her first press briefing as Delhi CM , Rekha Gupta had said that her government will table the CAG reports in the first Assembly session.
 
NEW DELHI: The 
Delhi government
 will table the long-pending Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) reports in the Assembly on February 25. The reports, which examine the financial and administrative performance of the previous 
Aam Aadmi Party
 (AAP) government, had been at the centre of a political tussle between the two parties.
Delhi LG VK Saxena has appointed 
BJP
 MLA Arvinder Singh Lovely as the pro tem speaker of the Delhi assembly.
According to the legislative assembly bulletin, the first session of the eighth Delhi Assembly will commence on 24th February, with the oath-taking ceremony for newly elected MLAs in the morning, followed by the election of the Speaker in the afternoon. On 25th February, Lieutenant Governor V K Saxena will address the House, after which the 
CAG reports
 will be presented. The session will reconvene on 27th February for discussions on the motion of thanks and the election of the Deputy Speaker.
BJP MLA Vijender Gupta, who has been elected as the Speaker, had confirmed the tabling of the CAG reports. ""The CAG reports will be tabled on 25th February,"" he said in a post on X after meeting Delhi chief minister 
Rekha Gupta
 to discuss the agenda of the upcoming session. 
The BJP had previously accused the AAP government of deliberately stalling the release of the reports to conceal corruption. During AAP's rule, the party had moved court seeking directions for the reports to be tabled, a demand that is now being fulfilled under the BJP-led administration.
Rekha Gupta, who took office as Delhi chief minister on February 20, had defended her government's swift decisions amid criticism from opposition parties. ""The Congress ruled for 15 years and AAP for 13. Instead of questioning us, they should reflect on their own record. Within a day of taking office, we cleared the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, which AAP had blocked, providing Rs 10 lakh in benefits to Delhi residents,"" she stated.
She also took aim at the opposition, suggesting that the CAG reports could reveal damaging details about the previous administration. ""They are worried that once the CAG reports are tabled, many records will be exposed,"" she said.
In addition to addressing financial transparency, the BJP government has pledged to prioritise pollution control and infrastructure projects. After participating in the evening Aarti on the Yamuna’s banks, Rekha Gupta reiterated her commitment to cleaning the river, a key issue during the Assembly elections. The BJP had previously criticised AAP for failing to address pollution and encroachment along the river.

The case involves a car crash early Wednesday that left two brothers Prasun Dey (45), Pranay Dey (44), and Pranay's son Pratip (14) critically injured, while Prasun's wife Romi, daughter Priyamvada, and sister-in-law Sudeshna were found dead in their home in the Tangra neighbourhood.
The autopsy revealed Romi had injuries on both wrists and a throat slash, while Sudeshna suffered similar wounds - indicating murder. Priyamvada, 14, died of poisoning and had multiple injury marks, suggesting she suffered before death. However, the two women had no traces of poison.
Police have registered a murder case on the basis of a complaint by Romi's father against unknown persons. However, police have not ruled out a possible suicide pact involving Sudeshna and Romi.
Pranay and Prasun said their wives were part of a collective death plan. The nature of the cuts suggested the women were unconscious or asleep when attacked. The brothers said the family had sleeping pills mixed in 'payesh' (kheer).

Maulvi held for hate speech that led to Mysuru police station mob attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maulvi-held-for-hate-speech-that-led-to-mysuru-police-station-mob-attack/articleshow/118428371.cms,Karnataka,Mysuru,"MYSURU: Karnataka Police on Thursday arrested a maulvi for allegedly making a provocative speech that led to a mob attacking Udayagiri police station in Mysuru, injuring police personnel and damaging official vehicles, on the night of Feb 10.
City police commissioner Seema Latkar said Mufti Mustaq Maqbooli was arrested and produced before a local court, which remanded him in judicial custody. He has been booked for delivering hate speech and outraging religious feelings under Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.
According to sources, the maulvi in his speech referred to a controversial social-media post targeting a specific religious community following Delhi assembly election results. His provocative remarks allegedly instigated a mob to gather outside the police station and resort to stone-pelting, demanding action against a Mysuru resident who made the offensive post. Police have booked about 1,000 people on charges of rioting, unlawful assembly and stone-pelting, and 17 people have been arrested so far.
Sources claimed four more youths had been detained for hurling stones at police vehicles, including that of DCP (traffic and crime) S Janhavi, when she was on her way to the police station after the crowd gathered there. Police have denied permission for processions to condemn the attack on the police station. Dalit Mahasabha members had sought permission to hold a mega awareness rally on Feb 24, while Rashtra Suraksha Janandolana Samithi had applied for permission to organise 'Mysuru Chalo' march on the same day and route.

Assam probing Pakistan activist's 18 visits to India: CM Himanta Biswa Sarma,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/assam-probing-pakistan-activists-18-visits-to-india-cm-himanta-biswa-sarma/articleshow/118428130.cms,Assam,General News,"GUWAHATI: Assam CM 
Himanta Biswa Sarma
 said on Thursday that 
Pakistani climate activist
 Ali Tauqeer Sheikh visited India 18 times between 2010 and 2018, while indicating that the state police's investigation into his activities and connections could have serious political repercussions.
""We will know who invited and hosted him during those visits,"" the CM said, speaking during the assembly session. He said within three months, police would present evidence that could prove ""fatal for Congress"".
Assam police have initiated a probe against Sheikh under BNS and UAPA for allegedly abetting offences outside India that endanger the country's sovereignty and communal harmony.
Sheikh has been accused of interfering in Assam's internal matters. The controversy stems from his alleged social media activities, which Sarma said focus less on climate action and more on the state's Hindu-Muslim dynamics, issues of immigration, and internal political affairs.
A police SIT has been tasked with uncovering details regarding his activities. The CM also hinted at the possibility of involving NIA if state police reached a dead end in their probe, signalling the national significance of the investigation.
""I promise that we'll break this Ali Tauqeer network and will come back to the assembly in the month of Aug. Give us just three months. We'll come back with facts which will be used. I know the facts, informally. But these facts have to be on record. It will be fatal for Congress. It will shock everyone in Assam,"" Sarma said.

Karnataka cabinet nod for bills against loan sharks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-cabinet-nod-for-bills-against-loan-sharks/articleshow/118427864.cms,Karnataka,General News,"BENGALURU: Despite concerns raised by state governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot, the Karnataka cabinet on Thursday approved amendments to two key bills, strengthening penalties against cooperative societies and pawnbrokers charging exorbitant interest rates.
Following last week's 
microfinance regulatory ordinance
, the state cabinet cleared amendments to 
Exorbitant Rate of Interest Act
 in the cooperative sector and Pawnbrokers Regulatory Act, increasing imprisonment terms and penalties for violations.
""The amendments are consequential in nature, as they follow the microfinance regulatory ordinance passed earlier this week. While they are not part of the ordinance, it is a decision to strengthen these laws as they are related to the same,"" HK Patil, state's law and parliamentary affairs minister, said.
The Microfinance Regulation Bill had already set stringent terms of up to 10 years in prison and a fine of Rs 5 lakh for violators.
 The cabinet also discussed the ""transfer of development rights"" (TDR) dispute with Mysuru royal family, following a Supreme Court decision awarding Rs 3,000 crore worth of TDR.

Rekha Gupta
 and her ministers on Thursday hit the ground running with focus on ""Maa Yamuna."" The chief minister attended a grand ""Yamuna Aarti"" on Vasudev ghat before chairing her first cabinet meeting which announced implementation of the Ayushman Bharat scheme - one of the key poll promises made by 
BJP
 to the people of Delhi during elections.
That ""clean Yamuna project"" was important for the BJP was evident from the fact that the process to start cleaning the river had started even before the government was formed. ""We want to make Maa Yamuna clean and free-flowing. This marks the beginning of the BJP's commitment,"" party's Delhi unit chief Virendra Sachdeva had said emphasising the government's dedication.
Yamuna pollution
 has been one of the key election issues in Delhi for long. When 
Arvind Kejriwal
 became the chief minister in 2015 with a massive mandate, he promised to clean the Yamuna in 5 years. Ironically, ten years into power, he did little and in 2025 the people of Delhi turned to the BJP which promised a slew of measures in its manifesto to restore the lost glory of 
Yamuna river
.
We will collaborate with central government to develop Yamuna River front on the lines of the Sabarmati Riverfront, ensuring 24x7 commercial establishments, interactive shows, theatres and other entertainment facilities along the riverbanks.
We will set up a Yamuna Kosh to revitalise the Yamuna river, which has been neglected by AAP-DA for the past 10 years
We will promote biodiversity along Yamuna’s banks by creating green corridors, wetlands and riverbank buffer zones
We will ensure zero industrial emissions into the Yamuna
We will organise an annual Yamuna Festival
A month back, when the campaigning for assembly elections was at its peak, Kejriwal, who failed to live up to his promise of cleaning the Yamuna, added a completely new dimension to the Yamuna politics. The AAP chief accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna water that comes to Delhi.
""BJP's Haryana government has poisoned the water in Yamuna. If this water would have entered Delhi only to be mixed with the drinking water, many people would have died in Delhi. It would have caused mass genocide,"" the former Delhi chief minister had then alleged. 
""A few countries use biological weapons to poison river water. But, the same has been done by the BJP government. They have done this to create chaos in Delhi so that the people of Delhi die and the blame comes on AAP. I want to tell BJP to not stoop this low,"" he also added.
Clearly, this was an extreme which took everyone, even the people of Delhi, by surprise. BJP leader and former Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar claimed that Kejriwal's posioned water statement cost him very dear in elections. ""If he had not made such a statement, his party would have won 5-7 seats more,"" Khattar asserted, adding ""More than 40 per cent of Delhi's residents are from Haryana. This statement insulted people of Haryana and Delhi both."" 
Well, it would be difficult to quantify the extent of loss that the poison attack caused, one thing is sure that the people of Delhi did not buy the theory as the results showed.
Interestingly, Arvind Kejriwal had also performed Yamuna Aarti at Gita ghat in November 2015 after becoming the chief minister to mark the beginning of his promise to clean the river. However, 10 years down the line Yamuna pollution was one of the key factors that led to his defeat. The BJP realises the importance of Yamuna in capital politics and that perhaps explains why Rekha Gupta did not want to miss the opportunity of sending out a strong message to people of Delhi on Day 1.

India, with an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 111, comes next only to south Asian neighbours Bangladesh at 140 and Pakistan at 115.
Indian cities dominated the list of the world's most polluted urban areas, with 125 out of the 145 worst-affected cities located in the country. The National Capital Region (NCR) topped the rankings, with New Delhi, Greater Noida, Noida, Ghaziabad, Faridabad, and Gurgaon securing the top six spots.
Trends
India
: In 2024, India ranked as the third most polluted country in the world, with an annual AQI average of 95, placing it in the ‘moderate’ category. Compared to 2023, there was no improvement in air quality, making pollution a constant concern throughout the year. Northern Indian cities witnessed significant pollution spikes, leading to several Indian cities being listed among the world’s 100 most polluted urban areas.
In 2024, only one city in India achieved ‘good’ air quality, while the remaining 365 cities recorded AQI levels ranging from Moderate to Poor and Unhealthy, highlighting the country's ongoing air pollution crisis.
People smoking without ever actually touching a cigarette 
In 2024, India’s annual average PM2.5 concentration (48 μg/m3) was equivalent to each individual inhaling the air pollution over the year, similar to smoking 796 cigarettes.

: Delhi set a new pollution record in November 2024, registering an AQI of 795, highest in the past four years, placing it in the ‘hazardous’ category. 
With an average AQI of 169 in the ‘unhealthy’ category, it was ranked as the most polluted city in both India and the world. Only two months of the year recorded moderate AQI levels, while pollution remained a serious concern for the rest of the year. November to January were the worst months, with AQI levels reaching the Hazardous category for 43 days.
In 2024, New Delhi’s annual average PM2.5 concentration stood at 95 μg/m³, exposing residents to air pollution levels equivalent to smoking throughout the year.
The report also cited possible reasons responsible for the ever increasing AQI in the national capital which included emissions from vehicles, stubble burning, pollutants from industry and construction activities.

Wife of jailed gangster arrested in Delhi on drug trafficking charges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wife-of-jailed-gangster-arrested-in-delhi-on-drug-trafficking-charges/articleshow/118425038.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"Representative image
 
NEW DELHI: Police here have arrested the wife of jailed gangster 
Hashim Baba
 from northeast Delhi's Welcome area on charges of drug trafficking, officials said on Thursday. Baba's 33-year-old wife Zoya was arrested with 225 grams of heroin that she was allegedly attempting to deliver, they said. 
Police had received a tip-off that indicated her involvement in drug peddling, following which they gathered further evidence against her. 
On Wednesday, police were informed about a drug delivery to an unknown recipient. They laid a trap and nabbed Zoya. 
Her husband has been in jail since last year for his alleged role in the murder of a gym owner in South Delhi's Greater Kailash. During his imprisonment, Baba reportedly made a 'judicial confession' implicating fellow gangster 
Lawrence Bishnoi
 in the crime. 
According to the police, Baba and Bishnoi forged a connection while the former was in Tihar Jail in 2021. 
Despite being moved to different jails, they continued their communication. Baba later claimed that Bishnoi provided him with a direct line of communication to carry on with criminal activities while in jail, including regular phone conversations and video calls.

Maharashtra minister Manikrao Kokate and brother convicted in forgery case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-minister-manikrao-kokate-and-brother-convicted-in-forgery-case/articleshow/118424497.cms,Maharashtra,General News,"NEW DELHI: Maharashtra agriculture minister 
Manikrao Kokate
 and his brother Sunil Kokate have been found guilty in a decades-old 
forgery case
. In a verdict on Thursday, the 
Nashik district court
 sentenced to two years in prison and fined Rs 50,000 each, bringing an end to legal proceedings that began in the late 1990s.
The case dated back to 1995, when former minister Tukaram Dighole filed a petition accusing the Kokate brothers of forging documents to fraudulently acquire housing under a government scheme. They allegedly misrepresented their income and falsely claimed they did not own any property to qualify for government-allocated flats.
A complaint was lodged at the Wada police station in Nashik, leading to the registration of a case under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code, including Section 420 (cheating), Section 465 (forgery), Section 471 (using forged documents), and Section 467.
Court records show that between 1995 and 1997, the brothers secured housing under false pretences, however investigations that followed revealed inconsistency in their claims. 
While there were four accused in the case, only the Kokate brothers have been sentenced as the court did not issue any punishment to the other two individuals involved.

"Surrender looted, illegally-held weapons within 7 days or face strict action: Manipur Governor's ultimatum",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/surrender-looted-illegally-held-weapons-within-7-days-or-face-strict-action-manipur-governors-ultimatum/articleshow/118420236.cms,Manipur,General News,"NEW DELHI: 
Manipur Governor Ajay Kumar Bhalla
 on Thursday issued an ultimatum to the people of the state urging them to 
surrender illegally held weapons
 within the next seven days. In a letter addressed to residents of both the Valley and Hills, Bhalla called for an end to hostilities and a return to normalcy.
He appealed particularly to the youth, urging them to voluntarily return looted or illegally possessed weapons to the nearest police station, security outpost, or camp. ""Your single act of returning these weapons can be a powerful gesture towards ensuring peace. I want to assure you that no punitive action would be initiated if such weapons are returned within the stipulated time. Thereafter, strict action will be taken for possession of such weapons,"" he warned.
""People of Manipur, both in Valley and Hills, have suffered immense hardship for the last over 20 months due to a series of unfortunate incidents affecting peace and communal harmony. In the greater interest of restoring normalcy, so that people can return to their normal day-to-day activities, all communities in the State must come forward to ensure cessation of hostilities and maintenance of peace & order in the society,"" the governor said.
The ultimatum comes amid ongoing violence and security operations in Manipur, where security forces have been conducting widespread crackdowns on militant groups. In recent operations, authorities have arrested multiple militants, including members of the United Kuki National Army and the banned Kangleipak Communist Party. 
Over the last two days, security forces seized a significant cache of arms and ammunition, including rifles, pistols, grenades, and mortars, from various districts. The rising stockpiling of illegal weapons has been a major concern for authorities, leading to repeated calls for disarmament.
The imposition of President’s Rule in Manipur on February 13 has further intensified security measures in the state. The decision came following the resignation of chief minister N Biren Singh, who stepped down amid prolonged ethnic violence that has claimed over 250 lives since May 2023. The state government had earlier withdrawn from the Suspension of Operations (SoO) agreement with the Kuki National Army and other armed groups, leading to renewed clashes.
The Coordinating Committee on Manipur Integrity (COCOMI), a Meitei civil society group, criticised the move as ""undemocratic"" and an attempt to destabilise the state further. In contrast, the Kuki Inpi, the apex body of Kuki tribes, welcomed it as a ""necessary intervention"" and reiterated their demand for a separate administration under Article 239(A) of the Constitution.

Tribunals can’t overturn its own finding on Assam foreigners: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tribunals-cant-overturn-its-own-finding-on-assam-foreigners-sc/articleshow/118408756.cms,Assam,General News,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has ruled that once a designated Foreigner Tribunals, rejects Assam government’s claim about a person being an illegal Bangladeshi immigrant who entered the state after March 25, 1971, the tribunal cannot review its own order on the administration’s fresh plea with additional documents.
A tribunal had on Feb 15, 2018, after considering oral and documentary evidence, in a case filed in 2016, decided that one Rejia Khatun was not a foreigner from Bangladesh who entered India on or after March 25, 1971.
There was another case registered in 2012 alleging the same person to be a foreigner from Bangladesh. This was taken up for hearing on Dec 24, 2019, and the tribunal ruled that despite its Feb 15 order, it had the power to scrutinize documents and materials and even its findings in earlier proceedings. This was challenged by Khatun before the Gauhati HC, which upheld the power of the tribunal to go into the question afresh notwithstanding the earlier decision declaring Khatun as not a foreigner.
Senior advocate Pijush Roy, appearing for Khatun, told a bench of Justices A S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan that the tribunals had no power to review its own orders. Accepting the argument, the bench said the state govt was a party to the 2018 order and neither did it seek recall of the order nor challenge it before the HC.
“The (Dec 2019) order indicates that the Tribunal wants to sit in an appeal against its own concluded judgment and order. Such power can never be exercised by the Tribunal. The remedy of the State Government or for that matter the Central Government was to challenge the order dated Feb 15, 2018,” it said.
The bench said the tribunal is powerless to reconsider its own orders and set aside the HC order as well as the Dec 24, 2019, decision of the tribunal. In addition, the bench shut out the Centre or Assam govt from challenging the tribunal’s 2018 order.

NEW DELHI: Yoga guru and Patanjali founder Ramdev blocked American entrepreneur Bryan Johnson on X after receiving a critical comment on his post. On Tuesday, Ramdev shared a post showing him running next to a horse while promoting Patanjali products, Immunogrit Gold and Swarna Shilajit. 
In response, Johnson commented on the post, highlighting India's air quality issues. He wrote, ""Air quality in Haridwar right now is PM₂.₅ 36 µg/m³, equivalent to smoking 1.6 cigarettes a day. This raises risks of heart disease by 40–50%, lung cancer by three times, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, and early death (5–7 years lost).""
Following this, Johnson said, ""I replied with this comment, and he hid it and blocked me.""
Johnson also posted a follow-up, stating, ""I suggest you organize yourselves and fight for better air quality. Bad air quality hurts you, your loved ones, and India. I’m trying to do you a favor and provoke a tipping point of collective action. I’m calling out that the most powerful people in India - for whatever reason - want to suppress the harsh reality that bad air is making you all sick."" 
Ramdev's post promoted the benefits of Patanjali products, stating, ""If you want to run like a horse, build strong immunity, and boost anti-ageing, consume Swarna Shilajit and Immunogrit Gold."" Patanjali was co-founded by Ramdev and Balkrishna in 2006.
Bryan Johnson, known for his anti-aging initiative ""Project Blueprint,"" is actively campaigning for longevity. 
His X bio reads, ""Conquering death will be humanity’s greatest achievement."" Johnson recently made headlines for walking out of a podcast with YouTuber Nikhil Kamath, citing concerns about India's pollution.
The millionaire, who invests heavily in his strict anti-aging regimen, claimed that his short visit to India negatively impacted his health due to poor air quality.

"After drubbing AAP in Delhi, 'Bangal cholo' next for BJP?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-drubbing-aap-in-delhi-bangla-chalo-next-for-bjp/articleshow/118116026.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"PTI photo (File)
 
NEW DELHI: Since 2014, the BJP has been moving from one poll victory to another -- both on the national as well as the state level -- with seemingly nothing able to stand in the way of the Modi wave. 
However, one thorn in BJP's side was Delhi, where the Arvind Kejriwal-led fortress managed to survive the saffron tsunami not once, but twice.
However, 2025 proved to be a breakthrough year as the BJP broke the 27-year-old jinx to storm back to power in the Capital. It defeated the indomitable Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) by winning 48 seats in the 70-member Delhi assembly.
Bristling with confidence after acquiring the Rajdhani in the North, the party has already given clear indications that its next mission is to make inroads in the eastern state of West Bengal.
Like Delhi, making inroads in the Mamata Banerjee-ruled Bengal has been an uphill task for the BJP for the past two assembly elections.
In the 2016 assembly elections, buoyed by the majority mandate at the Centre, the BJP expected to emerge as a key party but faced an embarrassing defeat. The party won only 3 seats in the 294-seat West Bengal assembly.
In 2019, the BJP came back to power at the Centre with an even bigger mandate and by then had a decent presence in even the northeastern states, where BJP had negligible presence before 2014.
Two years down the line, the party made another attempt to breach the fortress of Mamata Banerjee but to no avail. 
In 2021, when the results trickled in, the BJP won only 77 seats with TMC winning a whopping mandate by securing victory on 215 seats. Though the BJP vote and seat share improved substantially, it was far less than the 200-seat mark the party had expected to win in the polls.
Just like Delhi in 2015 and 2020, the BJP fell flat in Bengal in 2016 and 2021.
However, with the BJP finally triumphing in Delhi, Bengal BJP leaders now see the possibility that Bengal may not be ""mission impossible"" anymore.
As BJP was celebrating its victory in the Capital on February 8, its top Bengal leader Suvendu Adhikari shot off a salvo at CM Mamata Banerjee, saying after the national capital, Bengal would vote for the BJP by uprooting ruling TMC.
""Delhi ki jeet hamari hai ... 2026 mein Bengal ki baari hai … (Delhi's victory is ours ... in 2026 it will be Bengal's turn),"" Adhikari said while reacting to BJP's massive comeback after 27 years of political exile.
Pumped by the BJP's historic win in Delhi, Bengal BJP chief and Union minister Sukanta Majumdar said Delhi's victory would serve as a morale booster for party workers in West Bengal ahead of next year's assembly elections.
BJP's Amit Malviya, who heads the party's I-T department, said that ""jitters from the Delhi results are being felt in West Bengal"" and claimed that ""nervous"" Mamata Banerjee would go solo in next year's assembly polls.
""A nervous Mamata Banerjee has told TMC MLAs that there will be NO alliance in Bengal … It is not surprising that she applies a different yardstick to the opposition in Haryana and Delhi but is unwilling to cede space for the alliance at home,"" Malviya wrote on X.

"No discontent in Punjab AAP, asserts Bhagwant Mann; all MLAs attend Delhi meet",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-discontent-in-punjab-aap-asserts-bhagwant-mann-all-mlas-attend-delhi-meet/articleshow/118157908.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"NEW DELHI: Punjab CM 
Bhagwant Mann
 on Tuesday dismissed claims by Congress and BJP of unrest brewing among AAP MLAs, tamping down speculation that the ripples from AAP's Delhi debacle may pose a risk to his govt.
Talking to reporters after the surprise move of party boss Arvind Kejriwal to summon Punjab CM, ministers, MPs and MLAs to Delhi, Mann took on Congress and said ""switching sides is Congress's culture"" and reminded Partap Singh Bajwa, the leader of opposition in Punjab, that his party drew a blank in Delhi.
Ahead of the meeting, which AAP said was attended by all 92 Punjab MLAs, Bajwa had alleged that the party was preparing the ground to oust Mann from the CM's post. He had also claimed that over 30 AAP MLAs were in touch with his party. 
Meeting sparks speculation about instability in 
Punjab AAP
 Instead of counting our MLAs, he should see how many Congress candidates won in Delhi,"" Bhagwant Mann said. Kejriwal and other senior functionaries held a meeting with Punjab functionaries to ostensibly thank them for their involvement in Delhi campaign.
According to AAP, the meeting at Kapurthala House saw all MLAs from Punjab and MPs from the state come together in what the party projected as a show of solidarity and normalcy amid the gloom of the Delhi loss. Besides Kejriwal and former deputy CM Manish Sisodia, national organisational secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Sandeep Pathak and RS MP Raghav Chadha were present.
Kejriwal is learnt to have asked the Punjab MLAs to reconnect with voters while working unitedly to pave the way for AAP's return to office in 2027. The timing of the meeting following AAP's defeat in Delhi had sparked speculation about instability in the party's Punjab unit. Asked about Bajwa's allegation that he could quit AAP with a group of MLAs, Mann said, ""Let them say so. We cultivated the party with hard work by going to every nook and corner of the state. They don't worry about their own party and find fault with others. It is Congress that has a culture of switching parties.""
BJP's newly-elected Rajouri Garden MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa claimed Mann's ""nervousness and body language"" after the meeting ""supports the conspiracy theory"" that he had spoken of on Monday. Sirsa had alleged that Kejriwal was scripting a narrative to oust Mann. 
AAP's estranged RS MP Swati Maliwal also took a dig at Kejriwal and said, ""Some people have started treating Punjab as their personal ATM. Today, massive corruption is rampant in Punjab.""

NEW DELHI: Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann on Tuesday responded to Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa's claim that 30 Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs were in contact with him. 
""Pratap Singh Bajwa has been saying this for almost three years. Let him say whatever he wants. I would ask Pratap Singh Bajwa to count how many MLAs they (Congress) have in Delhi,"" Mann told reporters. 
Mann also said, ""He (Bajwa) has been making claims earlier also that 20 MLAs or 40 MLAs are in touch with him. Let them say it. We have formed this party with our sweat and blood, going among people in villages and towns in the state.""
Poll
Do you agree with the claim made by Congress?
No, it's just political talk
Yes, it seems likely
After AAP's loss in the Delhi assembly elections, Bajwa claimed that an internal struggle would start between Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann and AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal. He also said that over 30 AAP MLAs were in contact with the Congress and were ready to switch sides. 
Congress MP Pramod Tiwari, however, denied that AAP MLAs were in touch with either the BJP or Congress. He said Congress does not support breaking other parties but is observing the political situation in Punjab. 
""BJP has a history of horse-trading and breaking parties—we have seen this in Maharashtra, Goa, Manipur also. They will try to do this in Punjab as well. As far as Congress is concerned, we do not believe in breaking parties. Our party's state leadership is monitoring the situation over there,"" Tiwari said while talking to news agency ANI. 
Earlier in the day, Mann arrived at Kapurthala House in New Delhi for a meeting with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal amid reports of differences within AAP. 
""Our MLAs reached here, and we had a meeting with party national convenor Arvind Kejriwal. He thanked them all for campaigning during the Delhi Assembly elections. Our government in Punjab has always worked for public welfare, whether in education or infrastructure. We need to speed up… Winning and losing is a part of the game. People of Delhi still remember us as someone who worked for them. We have two years more in Punjab. We will make Punjab a good model,"" Mann told the media. 
AAP, which had ruled Delhi for ten years, won only 22 out of 70 seats in the February 5 elections, while the BJP secured a majority, ending AAP's rule in the capital. 
There is also speculation that Kejriwal may take a bigger role in Punjab politics, with discussions about him contesting the vacant Ludhiana Assembly seat. However, AAP MP Malvinder Singh Kang dismissed these reports, calling the meeting a ""routine strategy session."" 
Meanwhile, BJP leader Rohini Vijender Gupta criticized AAP, saying the party is struggling after its defeat in the Delhi elections. 
""Kejriwal is doing a meeting, but it is a sinking ship. They are trying to keep their people together...but it will not last long,"" Gupta said.

This is how BJP celebrated Delhi poll victory in Parliament,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/bjp-celebrates-delhi-poll-victory-with-modi-modi-chants-in-parliament/articleshow/118126100.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"NEW DELHI: BJP's victory in the Delhi polls was hailed by NDA members with chanting of ""Modi, Modi"" slogan in both houses of Parliament on Monday, while former Union minister Anurag Thakur took a jibe at Rahul Gandhi in Lok Sabha over Congress's dismal performance in elections in the capital over the years.
BJP members in Rajya Sabha also ridiculed AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal for having once said that PM Modi would have to be reborn to unseat AAP in Delhi. They also stated that ""people had shown the mirror to those living in Sheesh Mahal"".
Soon after Lok Sabha proceedings started, BJP MPs raised the slogan, to which Congress MPs objected. The sloganeering went on for a while before Speaker Om Birla called for the question hour.
Taking a jibe Rahul in Lok Sabha, Thakur said, ""Rahul Ji, zero check kar lijiye... (Rahul, please check the zero) as Congress has consecutively secured zero seats third time in a row. Referring to Congress' poor track record, he said, ""How many seats did people of Delhi give to Congress in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections? Zero. In 2015? Zero. In 2019? Zero. In 2020? Zero. In 2024? Zero. And in 2025? Zero.""
When proceedings of the upper house began, BJP members started sloganeering in support of PM Modi. However, sloganeering was paused for a while when Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar extended birthday greetings to BJP's Sanjay Seth. It again started, with BJP MPs chanting ""Delhi ke dil me Modi hai, Desh ke dil me Modi hai"".
Meanwhile, BJP MP from Maharashtra Medha Vishram Kulkarni, while praising the budget, referred to its impact in Delhi polls, saying, ""People showed a mirror to those living in Sheesh Mahal.""
Quoting a Hindi couplet, BJP MP Dinesh Sharma, without naming Kejriwal, said his haughtiness got a befitting answer in AAP's stinging defeat. ""The defeat came in this very birth,"" he quipped.
Meanwhile in Lok Sabha, Thakur questioned Congress leaders for not taking a holy dip during the Maha Kumbh and wondered if they had been directed not to do so by ""Uncle Soros and Uncle Sam."" Thakur said even former PM Jawaharlal Nehru took a dip in the Sangam but today's generation of the Congress is avoiding it.

Winning over Jats: How BJP scored a perfect 10 in Delhi elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/winning-over-jats-how-bjp-scored-a-perfect-10/articleshow/118126209.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"A notable win was Parvesh Verma's, which consolidated Jat youth support. Dissatisfaction with AAP's handling of rural problems and a lack of Jat representation in the INDIA bloc also contributed to BJP's success.
 
NEW DELHI: The BJP swept all 10 Jat-dominated constituencies in Delhi into its kitty, capturing territory that they did not have in the last two elections.
Party officials attributed the strong Jat support for the BJP to several factors, particularly the party's focus on addressing rural problems and its willingness to give tickets to several Jat functionaries.
A senior BJP functionary said that there were several problems in Jat-dominated areas, such as registries, a crumbling civic infrastructure, and a need for better connectivity. ""Through DDA and with the support of the lieutenant governor, some work was done. The Jats realised that central govt assistance could play a key role in their development, which was not happening,"" the BJP source said.
Days before the elections, the representatives from all 360 villages of Delhi declared their backing for BJP. Their decision stemmed from a general dissatisfaction with Delhi govt for its failure to resolve issues affecting rural communities.
Another BJP functionary said that giving a ticket to Parvesh Verma also helped, as it led to the consolidation of the community, especially the youth, in BJP's favour. 
He said the bitter political confrontation, when AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal called Verma a traitor for giving money to women through his NGO before the model code of conduct kicked in, also did not help AAP. ""When Kejriwal made personal statements targeting Parvesh Verma through his press briefings, he often made it a Jat issue as well,"" the BJP functionary said.
Also, when Verma was pitched against Kejriwal, it made the contest a battle of personalities, which led to a strong Jat backing for BJP. The BJP also swept outer Delhi seats, which were once the stronghold of his father and former chief minister Sahib Singh Verma.
Another functionary said that having senior Jat functionaries contesting the polls helped in different ways. When AAP raised the issue of Jat reservation, these functionaries were quick to respond that if the party was serious then it should have first brought the proposal in the Vidhan Sabha when it was ruling, but it never did. ""The voices got amplified,"" he said.
Paramjeet Sejwal, who lives in Lado Sarai, said: ""There were several reasons for the BJP's gain. The crumbling infrastructure when not much was happening on the development front was one. Second, people in the community saw leaders such as Kailash Gahlot leaving. Also, the INDIA bloc did not give any ticket to people from the Jat community. So, these factors started consolidating after a point.""
In Lado Sarai, which is part of the Jat-influenced seat of Mehrauli, Gajendra Yadav of BJP won by 1,786 votes. The margins in other seats were larger. In the Jat-dominated seat of Najafgarh, Neelam Pahalwan of BJP won by 29,009 votes against Tarun Kumar of AAP. Last time, AAP got 72,699 votes in this seat.
Gahlot, a former AAP govt minister who switched sides before the polls, won by 11,276 votes against Surendra Bharadwaj of AAP.
In the Palam constituency, a key seat where Jats are in significant numbers, Kuldeep Solanki of BJP won by a margin of 8,952 votes against Joginder Solanki of AAP. The AAP polled 73,094 votes in this seat.
In Nangloi Jat, Manoj Kumar Shokeen of BJP won against Raghuvinder Shokeen of AAP by a margin of 26,251 votes. The party won Narela by 8,596 votes, Rithala by 29,616, Mundka by 10,550 and Nangloi Jat by 26,251. In Vikaspuri, Matiala and Palam also , BJP got good winning margins.

The Delhi assembly's first session will begin on February 24, where MLAs will take their oath and elect a new Speaker.
""The report will be tabled in the House and many things will come to light. I think the truth will come out in the CAG report. Whether it is education, liquor, or Sheesh Mahal, many such issues will be raised in the House,"" said Khurana.
Khurana criticized AAP for not presenting the report earlier, emphasizing that the new BJP-led government would operate according to constitutional norms.
""The 8th assembly formed yesterday and its first session will begin tomorrow with the oath of the MLAs and the election of the Speaker and the next day the CAG report will be tabled.

AAP's national spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar responded by questioning BJP's commitment to their campaign promises, particularly regarding the Rs 2,500 financial assistance scheme for Delhi women.
""BJP should display optimistic politics. They should work on the promises they made to the people of Delhi instead of imposing their agenda. They said that in the first cabinet meeting, a resolution would be passed that every woman in Delhi would get Rs 2500 per month in her account,"" Kakkar said.
Kakkar pointed out that BJP had not addressed their promises in their first cabinet meeting, contrasting this with AAP's record of fulfilling their commitments when they came to power.

MSRTC workers' union said the security of bus drivers and conductors is now at stake.
On Saturday, the MSRTC cancelled 250 buses that operate between Maharashtra and Karnataka in the wake of the violence. Six of these buses operate from Pune. Abhijit Bhosle, the MSRTC public relations officer, said it is not certain whether the buses would operate on Sunday. ""We will take a call after consultation with police. At this moment, nothing can be said,"" the official told TOI. 
As the MSRTC buses towards Karnataka did not ply on Saturday, more than 20 buses from the Kolhapur Central bus stand were cancelled. Passengers were stranded at the bus stand.
Shiv Sena (UBT) workers protested against the incident at the Kolhapur Central bus stand on Saturday morning. They put up saffron flags on the Karnataka State Road Transport buses and raised slogans against the Karnataka govt. Shahupuri police detained the Shiv Sena (UBT) workers.
Vijay Dewane, the district convenor of Shiv Sena (UBT), said, ""The Maharashtra chief minister should immediately stop all the Karnataka buses from entering our state. Karnataka govt should apologise for this act, else a befitting reply will be given.""
The Maharashtra-Karnataka border dispute has been going on for several years now. Whenever the border dispute flares up, the first to bear the brunt often are the state transport buses. 
MSRTC bus conductor Prashant Thorat, who was in the bus that was attacked on Friday, said, ""Our driver, Bhaskar Jadhav, was driving the Bengaluru-Pune MSRTC bus from Chitradurga to Kolhapur when, around 9.30pm, activists of the Karnataka Navanirman Sene turned up in four to five vehicles and blocked the way. The activists, carrying red-yellow flags and scarves, the Jadhav if he could speak in Kannada. When the driver said no, he was pulled out of the bus. His face was blackened. The activists raised slogans screaming ‘If you can't speak Kannada, then you will not be allowed into Karnataka'. Black ink was also splashed on the bus. This continued for half an hour. Our bus was stranded there till 4 am and we, including all the passengers, were very scared as we didn't know the Kannada language either."" 
Repercussions of this incident are now likely to be felt in parts of Maharashtra as well. Uttam Patil, the divisional secretary of the MSRTC workers' union, said, ""There should be coordination between the two states regarding interstate traffic. The number of passengers travelling from Maharashtra to Karnataka is huge. If the corporation takes responsibility for the safety of drivers and conductors, we have no problem in going to Karnataka. MSRTC drivers and the general public are being dragged into the organisational and political tussle. The transport corporations of both states should sit together and decide on safety.""

"Won’t give in to ‘blackmail’, Centre makes it clear to Tamil Nadu",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wont-give-in-to-blackmail-centre-makes-it-clear-to-tn/articleshow/118490049.cms,Tamil Nadu,General News,"Won’t give in to ‘blackmail’, Centre makes it clear to TN (Pic credit: PTI)
 
NEW DELHI: In the midst of its escalating political standoff with Tamil Nadu govt over National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, Centre has made it clear that it is firmly committed to implementing the three-language policy at school level. Centre is steadfast in its stance and will not succumb to Tamil Nadu's ""blackmailing"" tactics, govt sources said.
Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, in a letter to Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Friday, criticised the state's opposition to NE, calling it ""highly inappropriate"" and a ""narrow-minded approach"". Pradhan sought to allay concerns raised by Tamil Nadu govt, saying, ""Let me unequivocally state that there is no question of imposing any language on any state or community.""
NE advocates a flexible three-language formula, emphasising multilingual education, while allowing states to choose their own languages within the framework. However, Tamil Nadu govt has consistently opposed the policy, arguing that it undermines the state's long-standing two-language formula and poses a potential threat to linguistic identity.
Despite the state's reservations, Union govt remains firm on implementing NE nationwide. Centre maintains that the policy is designed to enhance educational outcomes and foster multilingual proficiency without infringing upon regional linguistic preferences. Pradhan underscored this in his letter, stating, ""NE upholds the principle of linguistic freedom and ensures that students continue to learn in the language of their choice.""
""Apart from BJP-governed states there are multiple non-BJP states which are implementing this language policy. In fact, states like Assam and Odisha, among others, have been following a three-language formula till Class VIII which predates BJP govts there,"" said a senior govt official.
The three-language policy, which has been a part of India's education framework since 1968, has been a major point of contention for long. Pradhan argued that its lack of proper implementation over the decades has led to a decline in the systematic teaching of Indian languages and an over-reliance on foreign languages. ""NE seeks to correct this historical oversight by ensuring that every Indian language, including Tamil, receives its rightful place in education while maintaining the flexibility for states to design their own language policies,"" he wrote.
Pradhan cautioned that Tamil Nadu's continued opposition to NE could deprive its students, teachers, and educational institutions of the immense opportunities the policy offers.

"Raj CM gets 3rd death threat from jail in a year, this time from Jaipur's Dausa",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/raj-cm-gets-3rd-death-threat-from-jail-in-a-year-this-time-from-jaipurs-dausa/articleshow/118489732.cms,Rajasthan,Dausa,"File photo of Rajasthan chief minister Bhajanlal Sharma (Pic credit: PTI)
 
JAIPUR: An inmate at Dausa's high-security jail was arrested Saturday for ringing up 
Jaipur police control room
 and threatening to kill Rajasthan CM Bhajanlal Sharma, making the third death threat against him in the past year, reports
The caller, identified as 29-year-old Rinku, is serving a life sentence under Pocso Act. He warned: ""I will kill him before midnight."" The two calls made within a span of 10 minutes after midnight Saturday raised concerns about prison security and the unauthorised use of mobile phones by inmates.
An FIR was registered in Jaipur. ""Our teams searched the jail and took Rinku into custody. A cheap, keypad mobile phone with a SIM card, suspected to have been used to make the calls, was seized,"" Dausa ASP Guru Sharan said.
The latest security breach follows a similar call made from Dausa jail on July 27 last year. That case led to the suspension of three jail officials and prompted a search by police and jail authorities across the state's prisons. Multiple mobile phones were seized from inmates.
In Jan 2024, a prisoner from Jaipur central jail had also issued a threat to the CM.
Rinku was convicted in Jan 2020 for kidnapping and sexually assaulting a six-year-old in March 2019. He was lodged in Alwar jail before being transferred to Dausa jail - established in 2018 and designed to house criminals convicted of crimes such as murder and rape.
The fact that such calls continue to originate from high-security prisons has prompted a strong response from state govt. Minister of state for home Jawahar Singh Bedam said a high-level inquiry has been launched.
Authorities are investigating how Rinku managed to obtain the mobile phone. ""If any officer or jail staff member is found responsible, strict action will be taken against them,"" DIG Monika Agarwal said.
According to Agarwal, prisoner Rinku was disturbed due to conflicts with prison staff. ""He claims he made the call to draw the attention of senior officials,"" she said.

""The

Earlier this month, the state govt-appointed additional chief secretary (transport) Sanjay Sethi as chairperson MSRTC. Sarnaik was keen to get the post as in the past, all Sena transport ministers, such as Diwakar Raote and Anil Parab, were appointed MSRTC chairperson. Until recently, Sena MLA Bharat Gogawale was MSRTC chairperson. He resigned after he became a minister in the current Mahayuti govt.
The govt is already facing flak from the opposition for pruning the list of Ladki Bahin scheme beneficiaries.

The central agency seized 650 grams of gold and Rs 5 lakh in cash during its searches at 11 locations, including Vadodara, a CBI spokesperson said.
The CBI arrested 2008-batch IRPS officer Sunil Bishnoi, posted as a senior divisional personnel officer in Vadodara; 2018-batch IRPS officer Ankush Wasan, posted as divisional personnel officer in Vadodara; deputy chief commercial manager Sanjay Kumar Tiwari, posted at Mumbai's Churchgate; deputy station superintendent Neeraj Sinha; and nursing superintendent Dinesh Kumar, posted at Divisional Railway Hospital in Ahmedabad. Mukesh Meena, a private individual from Anand, was also arrested for his involvement, the CBI said.
They are accused of collecting bribes from railway employees by ensuring selection in an upcoming 'Limited Departmental Examination' for promotion in the railways.
The action came after the CBI on Tuesday registered an FIR against three Western Railway (WR) officials and a private individual following raids at multiple locations over allegations of bribery linked to departmental examination selections.
CBI investigations revealed that on Feb 13, Wasan directed Tiwari to identify at least ten candidates willing to pay bribes for favourable results. Tiwari contacted Meena, who confirmed collecting money from five candidates. Sinha also informed Tiwari that he found four candidates and collected money from three of them.
On Feb 17, Tiwari approached Rajendra Ladla, proprietor of Dhanraj Jewellers in Vadodara, inquiring about purchasing 400 grams of gold in cash, without an invoice. The following day, Tiwari met Meena in Anand and collected bribe money on behalf of the candidates.
""During the investigation, it is also revealed that a nursing superintendent in the WR was intercepted and 650 grams of gold was found with him, which was obtained by him from the jeweller after payment of around Rs 57 lakh (approx.), and the said gold was to be delivered to the accused senior divisional personnel officer,"" the CBI statement said.
The FIR has been registered under Section 61 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) for criminal conspiracy and Sections 7 and 8 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (amended 2018).
CBI officials said the investigation will focus on uncovering the full extent of the bribery network and identifying other potential beneficiaries and intermediaries. More searches and arrests are likely, they said.

EuRekha! BJP picks first-time MLA as Delhi’s 4th woman CM,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eurekha-bjp-picks-first-time-mla-as-delhis-4th-woman-cm/articleshow/118397639.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"NEW DELHI: Catching heavyweights and hopefuls in the party off-guard, BJP Wednesday chose a first-time MLA from Shalimar Bagh, 
Rekha Gupta
, as Delhi chief minister.
The fourth woman to get the top job in Delhi after Sushma Swaraj (BJP), Sheila Dikshit (Congress) and Atishi (AAP), Gupta, 50, will steer BJP's govt in the city, 27 years after the last one led by Swaraj.
After Gupta, a three-time councillor, was elected leader of the legislature party, she went to Raj Niwas and staked her claim to form the govt before LG V K Saxena. Her name had been proposed by MLAs Parvesh Verma, Satish Upadhyay and Vijender Gupta — all probable candidates for the coveted job before the central brass announced its decision.
Saxena greeted her with a bouquet and gave BJP the green signal for the swearing-in ceremony to be held at Ramlila Maidan on Thursday noon.
Gupta was accompanied to Raj Niwas by Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva and central observers for conducting the legislature party meet, Ravi Shankar Prasad and Om Prakash Dhankhar.
""I want to thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi, our party's top leadership and people of Delhi for giving me the responsibility to preside over a new era that is starting in Delhi after 27 years. This is a moment of pride for women across the country,"" said Gupta. ""To fulfill each and every commitment of BJP made to people of Delhi is the goal of my life,"" she said. ""All MLAs will work like Team Modi to fulfill these commitments,"" she added.
Gupta has been accorded 'Z' category security by Delhi Police.
The office of the party's Delhi unit on 14 Pant Marg had been decorated with flowers with the sound of dhol and shehnai wafting in the air. The MLAs started arriving at 6 pm with the meeting beginning around 7 pm and lasting for an hour.
Outside the venue, supporters of senior party functionaries and claimants to the top job, besides media personnel, had gathered in large numbers long before the meeting began. The supporters were shouting slogans in favour of their preferred choice, particularly Rekha Gupta and Parvesh Verma, in a show of strength.
Party sources said Delhi BJP Chief Virendra Sachdeva had a private discussion with Verma, Vijender Gupta and Upadhyay. Parvesh defeated AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal; Upadhyay has previously served as the party's state chief; and Vijender Gupta had managed to buck the trend by winning in the assembly polls in 2015 and 2020 in the face of an AAP wave. 
According to party sources, they are all being considered for important positions, including that of ministers, speaker and other posts.
When Verma came out of the meeting, he was asked if he was being considered for the post of deputy CM but he did not reply. ""We are going to the LG's office. It is a matter of happiness that a woman has been made CM,"" he said.
Most MLAs who emerged from the legislature party meeting stressed on the party's decision to appoint a woman CM, highlighting its dedication to 
women empowerment
. Party functionaries said she fulfilled three crucial criteria: that of being a woman, belonging to the Bania community and maintaining a low-key public profile. This is in keeping with the recent trend of the party going for relatively low-profile leaders for the chief minister's role as evident in other states.
BJP MP from South Delhi Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, who had drafted the party's manifesto, said after the meeting: ""She will prove to be the best chief minister of Delhi. The party has always been a pioneer in women empowerment, and this is another example of that. Delhi will now become the developed and prosperous capital of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's dreams.""
MP Manoj Tiwari, who was also present at the meeting, said, ""This is a message for women empowerment. It was our party that brought the women's reservation bill in Parliament, and now we have taken another step that proves our commitment to women empowerment.""

'Perform Al-Ameen salute': J&K medico alleges ragging in Karnataka college; 5 arrested,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jk-medico-alleges-ragging-in-vijayapura-college-5-held/articleshow/118397552.cms,Karnataka,General News,"VIJAYAPURA: A 22-year-old student from Kashmir studying at 
Al-Ameen Medical College
 in Vijayapura, about 500km from Bengaluru, has alleged he was ragged and assaulted by seniors during a cricket match and later in college hostel on Tuesday.
Vijayapura superintendent of police Laxman Nimbargi confirmed to TOI that Hamim was assaulted, and five seniors allegedly involved in the incident have been arrested on assault and ragging charges under Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and Karnataka Education Act, 1983.
However, the college played down the incident as ""a minor altercation"".
According to the 
Jammu Kashmir Students' Association
 (JKSA), Hamim, a second-year student from J&K's Anantnag, was assaulted by five students from the 2019 batch. JKSA national convener Nasir Khuehami claimed Hamim had been subjected to ""months of harassment due to a power struggle"" as he captains the 2023-batch cricket team.
The accused arrested have been identified as Mohammed Zainul, 23, from Vijayapura; Sameer, 24, from Sandur, Ballari district; Shaik Sawood, 23, from Mudagal, Raichur district; Mansoor Bhasha, 24, from Shiraguppa, Ballari district; and Muzzaffer alias Mujeeb Jamadar, 23, from Indi Taluk, Vijayapura district.
The alleged incident took place Tuesday evening during a match between the 2019 and 2022 batches. ""While standing near the boundary line, a senior asked him to stay outside. He promptly moved away. As verbal intimidation escalated, seniors humiliated him, ordered him to perform an ‘Al-Ameen salute', sing songs, and dance for their amusement. They even attempted to force him into their car,"" Khuehami alleged.
When Hamim refused, citing college regulations, tensions escalated. ""Sensing danger, he took out his phone to record the incident, hoping it would deter them. Instead, this enraged them. Later in the evening, 6-8 individuals stormed into his hostel room and assaulted him. They repeatedly beat him, forced him to record a video apologising under duress, and issued death threats, warning he would not be allowed to play cricket for the next four years,"" Khuehami added.
Following a social-media post tagging PM Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah, J&K CM Omar Abdullah, Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah and deputy CM DK Shivakumar, the matter drew attention of Vijayapura Rural police officials, who visited the college to conduct an inquiry.
Dr Jilani Awati, medical college superintendent, said, ""The incident was a quarrel between two student teams during the cricket match. Hamim might have informed the Kashmiri student leader, who, unaware of the full context, sought help by tagging officials on social media. Disciplinary action will be taken if any misconduct is proven.""
He said the college has a strict anti-ragging policy, claiming, ""In our 40 years of existence, no case of ragging has been reported.""

Assam tribunal on foreigners can't overturn own finding: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/assam-tribunal-on-foreigners-cant-overturn-own-finding-sc/articleshow/118397414.cms,Assam,General News,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has ruled that once a designated Foreigners Tribunal rejects Assam govt's claim that a person is an illegal Bangladeshi immigrant who entered the state after March 25, 1971, the tribunal cannot review its own order based on the administration's fresh plea and additional documents.
A tribunal had on Feb 15, 2018, after considering oral and documentary evidence in a case filed in 2016, decided that one Rejia Khatun was not a foreigner from Bangladesh who entered India on or after March 25, 1971.
There was another case registered in 2012 alleging the same person to be a foreigner from Bangladesh. This was taken up for hearing on Dec 24, 2019, and the tribunal ruled that despite its Feb 15 order, it had the power to scrutinise documents and materials and even its findings in earlier proceedings. This was challenged by Khatun before Gauhati HC, which upheld the power of the tribunal to go into the question afresh notwithstanding the earlier decision declaring Khatun as not a foreigner.
Senior advocate Pijush Roy, appearing for Khatun, told a bench of Justices A S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan that the tribunals had no power to review its own orders. Accepting the argument, the bench said state govt was a party to the 2018 order and neither did it seek recall of the order nor challenge it before the HC.
""The (Dec 2019) order indicates that the tribunal wants to sit in an appeal against its own concluded judgment and order. Such power can never be exercised by the tribunal. The remedy of the state govt or for that matter the central govt was to challenge the order dated Feb 15, 2018,"" it said. 
The bench said the tribunal is powerless to reconsider its own orders and set aside the HC order as well as the Dec 24, 2019, decision of the tribunal. In addition, the bench shut out the Centre or Assam govt from challenging the tribunal's 2018 order.

A six-month-old tiger cub was killed after being hit by an unidentified vehicle while crossing the Rampur-Haldwani road in the Tanda range of the 
Terai Central Forest Division
, about 1.5 km from Sanjay Van around 9pm Tuesday, officials said. Tanda range officer Roop Narayan Gautam and his team reached the spot upon receiving the information and took the cub's carcass into custody. 
""The vehicle that struck the cub remains unidentified. An autopsy will be conducted Wednesday and we are initiating legal action against the unknown driver,"" Gautam said. He added that tigers, elephants, and other wildlife frequently cross this stretch of road. 
""A tigress was spotted in the area a few days ago. The deceased cub likely belonged to her,"" he said. This is not the first such incident. On Jan 6 last year, a six-year-old tiger was fatally hit by a car. Several similar accidents have been reported in the past. In 2023, a six-year-old tiger was fatally struck by a speeding car on the Haldwani road near Rudrapur. Uttarakhand recorded 15 tiger deaths in 2024, down from 22 in 2023, with causes including natural factors, territorial fights, and accidents. While poaching cases have significantly declined, authorities remain concerned about the impact of road traffic on wildlife movement.

‘Accidental death’ in Gujarat turns out to be murder by same-sex partner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/accidental-death-in-gujarat-turns-out-to-be-murder-by-same-sex-partner/articleshow/118396757.cms,Gujarat,General News,"SURAT: What initially seemed like an accidental death at an embroidery unit in Katargam was uncovered as a premeditated murder by a 19-year-old who allegedly strangled his 24-year-old gay partner on Feb 8.
The investigation and subsequent arrest of the accused revealed that he was upset over the victim's involvement with other men and a video of their sexual act recorded on the victim's phone.
On Feb 8, the accused tried to disguise the 24-year-old partner's killing as a death caused by accidental strangulation in a machine. The accused also wanted the victim to delete a video of their engagement in a sexual act that he recorded on his phone, as revealed by the investigation by the Katargam police.
To avoid suspicion, the accused himself went to the hospital with the victim and also attended his last rites in their native place in Bihar.
Katargam police inspector B K Chaudhary told TOI: ""While investigating at the crime scene, we found a mobile phone dumped under the machine in which the victim got strangled and died. We registered an accidental death case and began an investigation. We handed over the body to the deceased's family, who took him to Bihar. Our probe found many suspicious things which led us to the accused, who murdered the victim and tried to disguise it as an accidental death.""
The duo lived in a room in the Katargam area and were in a same-sex relationship. During one tryst, the accused shot a video, which the teenager did not like. Moreover, the accused also did not like his partner having relationships with other men. He threatened to kill the victim in the past and quarrelled in the presence of their roommates many times.
On Feb 8, when the 24-year-old was on night duty at the embroidery unit, the accused, who worked in a neighbouring factory, went there. Before his partner arrived, the victim switched off his mobile phone and hid it under the machine because he did not want to delete the video. When the accused insisted on handing over the phone to him to delete the video, the victim refused. The accused then allegedly strangled the victim with his gamchha (scarf) and set the body inside the machine in a manner that made it look like an accidental death.
""We found important evidence on the victim's phone. We also found the accused's movements suspicious in CCTV footage. The light on the stairs of the unit would always be on, but that night, someone switched it off. We connected the dots and sent a team to Bihar to nab the assailant, who went to the funeral of the victim as he was a close friend. We apprehended him and brought him to Surat. He confessed to the crime,"" Chaudhary said.

Plan to divert Manikaran ‘holy water’ in Himachal Pradesh stirs row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/plan-to-divert-manikaran-holy-water-in-himachal-pradesh-stirs-row/articleshow/118396685.cms,Himachal Pradesh,General News,"KULLU: A proposal to transfer water from the natural hot water springs at Manikaran - a site of pilgrimage for both Hindus and Sikhs - to the nearby popular tourist destination of Kasol, 4km away, in Parvati Valley of Kullu district has upset the locals. Residents have threatened mass agitation if the plan to ""use the holy water for commercial purposes"" is not withdrawn.
It was proposed at the recent meeting of the Special Area Development Authority that a new nature park would be built in Kasol, having 'jacuzzi hot baths', water for which would be brought from Manikaran through a network of pipes.
Enraged by the proposal, Manikaran residents met Kullu deputy commissioner Torul S Ravish and sent a memorandum to the CM, demanding scrapping of the plan. ""Manikaran is a site of pilgrimage, and no one should be allowed to misuse the water. If govt wants to build hot baths, then they should do it in Manikaran itself,"" said Narender Kumar, a local. He added that even the deities were against transferring water from Manikaran to Kasol.
Opposing the project, local resident Shailender Sharma said, ""Imposition of 
SADA in Manikaran
 has led to zero development, and now they want to take away our water... we would not let them do so."" The proposal has also sparked a war of words among local politicians. BJP's Narotam Thakur accused Kullu's Cong MLA Sundar Singh Thakur of having ""vested interest"" in the project. ""It's a bad idea to transfer the holy water of Manikaran, which is a globally famous religious site. Neither the people of Manikaran want the water to be diverted nor the people of Kasol. It's just the local MLA...,"" he added.
Last week, former MP Maheshwar Singh had publicly voiced opposition to the proposal, saying that the water from a sacred site like Manikaran should not be used for commercial purposes as ""the holy water of Manikaran is used even by the local deities"". Responding to the allegations, Kullu MLA Sunder Singh Thakur had last week said, ""Whenever we have talked about development, some people in Kullu have opposed it, making religion an excuse. They opposed projects from the ski village to even paragliding in Dhalpur, Kullu. But no one will be allowed to thwart the development process on the pretext of religion.""

"Car crash in Kolkata leads to 3 bodies at home, cops suspect suicide pact",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/car-crash-in-kolkata-leads-to-3-bodies-at-home-cops-suspect-suicide-pact/articleshow/118396594.cms,West Bengal,Kolkata,"KOLKATA: A car crash on EM Bypass early Wednesday that left three members of a family gravely injured, followed by the discovery of three lifeless bodies of family members of the crash survivors at their home in Kolkata's Tangra has left police sniffing a suicide pact, even though they have also lodged a murder complaint.
Police suspect the family members were driven to take the extreme step after failing to recover from Covid-time losses in their leather goods manufacturing trade. The family lived jointly in a four-storey house. The chain of events, at least the public part of it, began at 3.35am near Avishikta crossing, when a sedan - occupied by Prasun Dey, 45, Pranay Dey,44, and Pratip Dey,14, Pranay's son - dashed into a pillar at 100kmph, smashing the vehicle beyond recognition. Miraculously, all the three occupants were alive, and taken to hospital.
The next link of the macabre chain fell into place six hours later, when Pranay told cops from his hospital bed that there were three women lying dead at his house - his wife Sudeshna, sister-in-law Romi and niece Priyamvada, joint CP Rupesh Kumar told TOI. Pranay said the family had consumed payesh (a traditional dessert) laced with sedatives in order to die, and some of them also inflicted injuries on themselves. He said the three of them then set out in the car to die by suicide. Pratip was sitting in rear seat with his father, while his brother was driving.
Cops rushed to the Deys's house and broke open the main door lock to gain entry. On the first floor, they found the three bodies in different rooms. Police surmise that the car crash was deliberate, part of a suicide pact between the six members of the family.

From RSS to Delhi CM: Journey of Rekha Gupta,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-rss-to-delhi-cm-journey-of-rekha-gupta/articleshow/118395100.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"NEW DELHI: 
Rekha Gupta
, a first-time MLA and long-time RSS associate, is set to become the fourth woman chief minister of Delhi, marking the BJP’s return to power in the capital after 27 years. Gupta, 50, was chosen as the Leader of the House in the Delhi Assembly at the 
BJP
 legislature party meeting on Wednesday, ending the decade-long rule of the 
Aam Aadmi Party
 under Arvind Kejriwal.
Born in Haryana's Julana, Gupta pursued a BCom from Delhi University's Daulat Ram College before earning a law degree from Chaudhary Charan Singh University, Meerut. She has been actively involved in politics since her college days, starting her journey with the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) in 1992. She went on to serve as the secretary of the Delhi University Students' Union in 1995-96 and became its president in 1996-97.
Gupta’s association with the RSS spans over three decades, and she joined the BJP in 2002. She has since held key positions, including national secretary of the party’s youth wing and in-charge of the BJP women’s wing in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. Currently, she serves as the national vice-president of the BJP Mahila Morcha and is a member of the party’s national executive.
Her political career includes three terms as a councillor, representing North Pitampura from 2007 to 2017 and Shalimar Bagh from 2022 onwards. She has been at the forefront of women’s welfare initiatives, launching the Sumedha Yojana to support economically weaker female students in pursuing higher education. As the head of the Women Welfare and Child Development Committee in the civic body, she led multiple campaigns for women's empowerment.
Gupta’s appointment makes her the fourth woman chief minister of Delhi, following in the footsteps of Sushma Swaraj, Sheila Dikshit, and Atishi. She is also the fourth BJP leader to hold the position after Madan Lal Khurana, Sahib Singh Verma, and Sushma Swaraj. Upon taking the oath, she will become the only woman chief minister in any BJP-ruled state.
The swearing-in ceremony is set to take place at Ramlila Maidan on Thursday, and will be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other dignitaries. Gupta expressed her gratitude towards the party leadership in a post on X, vowing to work for the welfare, empowerment, and development of Delhi’s residents.
In the recent Delhi Assembly elections, Gupta won the Shalimar Bagh seat by over 29,000 votes, defeating AAP’s Bandana Kumari. The BJP secured a historic victory, winning 48 out of 70 seats, while AAP was reduced to 22 seats, and Congress failed to secure any.
The announcement of her appointment was met with celebrations by BJP workers and supporters, including her husband, Manish Gupta. Party leaders hailed her selection, with BJP MP Manoj Tiwari congratulating her on social media. Security arrangements have been ramped up for the oath-taking ceremony, with over 25,000 personnel deployed across key areas in Delhi.

NEW DELHI: The Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) marked a significant milestone with the inauguration of its newly-reconstructed 
Keshav Kunj building
 in New Delhi. 
At the 'Praveshotsav' event RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat emphasised that the grandeur of the building must reflect in the organisation’s work and commitment to the nation. ""Our work must uphold the grandeur of this new building,"" Bhagwat said.
Addressing the gathering, Bhagwat highlighted the continuous expansion of the Sangh’s activities across the country, stressing the need for every Swayamsevak to remain dedicated and disciplined. He underscored that while the organisation has witnessed changes in circumstances, its core direction must remain unwavering. “Prosperity is necessary, but it must come with discipline and limits,” he stated, urging members to uphold their responsibilities diligently.
“The newly constructed building by Keshav Smarak Samiti is undoubtedly grand. However, with this grandeur comes responsibility, and we must work accordingly to uphold its stature,” Bhagwat added.
The event was also attended by Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas treasurer, Govinddev Giri Maharaj, drew parallels between the Sangh’s mission and the legacy of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. While mentioning the film ""Chhaava"", based on the life of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, he reminded attendees of Shivaji's fearless warriors and emphasised that Sangh Swayamsevaks should embody similar unwavering dedication.
Raghavanand Maharaj of Udaseen Ashram, Delhi, also addressed the gathering, recognising RSS’s near-century-long journey and its unwavering service to society. President of Keshav Smarak Samiti, Alok Kumar Ji detailed the historical journey of Keshav Kunj, tracing its origins back to 1939. He elaborated on the multiple phases of its expansion, culminating in the latest reconstruction efforts that began in 2016. 
The newly built facility consists of three towers — Sadhana, Prerana, and Archana — and includes modern amenities such as the Ashok Singhal Auditorium, Keshav Library, an OPD clinic, Suruchi Prakashan, and a Hanuman temple. The building is also equipped with a 150-kilowatt solar plant and a 140 KLD capacity sewage treatment plant for sustainability.
The event was also attended by Union home minister Amit Shah, defense minister Rajnath Singh, health minister JP Nadda, RSS sah-sarkaryavah Krishna Gopal, and other senior functionaries and swayamsevaks.

Rekha Gupta to be Delhi CM: Frontrunners lose race again as BJP picks first-time MLA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rekha-gupta-is-delhi-cm-bjp-surprises-again-picks-first-time-mla-over-heavyweights/articleshow/118393944.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"NEW DELHI: Another state, another surprise pick. The BJP has done it again. On Wednesday, the BJP, which returned to power in Delhi after 27 long years, picked first-time MLA 
Rekha Gupta
 as its chief minister. While the announcement ended days of suspense and speculation, it did reinforce the notion that being a heavyweight or a frontrunner for the top post in any BJP-ruled state is actually a disadvantage.
The likes of 
Parvesh Verma
, 
Vijender Gupta
 - party's old warhorses in Delhi, would perhaps have known the disadvantages of being frontrunners in this race even as they would have hoped for an exception from the party high command. 
When it comes to selecting chief ministers, the BJP's script has been the same - state after state. Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Odisha, Gujarat, Haryana - all these BJP-ruled states have chief ministers who were relatively unknown figures in the party till they were picked to lead the state. The heavyweights and the frontrunners in these states lost the race to the top post.
With Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself leading the campaign in all state elections, the BJP uses CM pick keeping in mind long-term gains for the party.
Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Goa CM Pramod Sawant and Uttarakhand's Pushkar Singh Dhami are some of the BJP chief ministers who could buck the trend and continue with the top post after the party's victory.
To that extent, Rekha Gupta should consider herself lucky as her name was also doing the rounds for the top post in Delhi. A number of factors could have helped Rekha Gupta pip the heavyweights, who played crucial role in BJP's victory.
Rekha Gupta will be the only woman chief minister among the states being ruled by the BJP at present.
She enjoys close ties with the RSS and is actively engaged with women-related matters. 
Gupta is also the national vice president of BJP Mahila Morcha and a member of the party's national executive.
She is a former president of the Delhi University Students' Union (DUSU) and a civic body councillor. 
Rekha Gupta entered politics as an Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) member in 1992.
Immediately after the formal announcement, the Delhi CM-designate thanked the top BJP leadership for reposing confidence in her. ""I thank the top leadership from my heart for its belief in me for entrusting me with the post of Chief Minister. This faith and support have evoked a new energy and motivation in me. I pledge to strive with total honesty, commitment and dedication for the welfare of the residents of Delhi. I am fully committed to the significant responsibility of taking Delhi to a new pinnacle,"" she said in a post on X in Hindi.

Follow live updates: Rekha Gupta announced as Delhi CM
She started her political journey in 1992 through the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) at Daulat Ram College, Delhi University. In 1996-97, she became President of the Delhi University Students' Union (DUSU), where she worked on student issues.
In 2007, Gupta was elected as a councillor from North Pitampura, where she helped improve local facilities like libraries, parks, and swimming pools. She also launched the ""Sumedha Yojana"" to support economically weaker female students in higher education. As Chair of the Women Welfare and Child Development Committee, she led initiatives for women's empowerment.
Gupta also served as General Secretary of BJP Mahila Morcha in Delhi and on its national executive committee.
Rekha, 50 years old, was born in 1974 in Nandgarh village, located in Jind district, Haryana. Her father held an officer position at the State Bank of India. In 1976, when Rekha was just two years old, her family moved to Delhi. She completed her primary to higher education in Delhi thereafter.

Gupta, who secured a decisive victory in the recently concluded assembly elections from Shalimar Bagh, will take the oath of office on Thursday at Ramlila Maidan.
A seasoned BJP leader, Gupta has held several key positions within the party. She previously served as the general secretary and president of the Delhi University Students' Union (DUSU) and is a member of the party’s national executive. Her political journey includes two successful terms as a councillor, representing Uttari Pitampura in 2007 and North Pitampura in 2012.
Gupta’s rise to the chief ministerial post follows her triumph over AAP's Bandana Kumari by a margin of 29,595 votes.
The BJP announced its chief ministerial candidate at the last moment as part of its political strategy. Several names were in contention for the post, including Parvesh Verma, Vijender Gupta, Harish Khurana and Shikha Roy. There was also speculation about nominating MPs such as Manoj Tiwari and Bansuri Swaraj for the position.
Preparations are in full swing as the BJP returns to power in Delhi after a 27-year gap, having secured victory in the February 5 assembly elections. The party ended its exile by defeating the 
Aam Aadmi Party
, marking a significant political comeback. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah, BJP-ruled state chief ministers, NDA leaders, Union ministers, and other prominent figures are expected to attend the ceremony, according to party sources. 
In the results declared on February 8, the BJP secured 48 seats, significantly weakening AAP, which saw its representation drop below one-third of the total seats. The party also claimed major wins by defeating key AAP leaders, including former chief minister and AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal in New Delhi, Manish Sisodia in Jangpura, and Saurabh Bharadwaj in Greater Kailash. 
In the 2020 elections, AAP had won 62 seats, while BJP managed only 8. In 2015, AAP secured a landslide victory with 67 seats, leaving BJP with just 3. This election saw a direct contest between BJP and AAP, while Congress remained on the sidelines, failing to win a single seat for the third consecutive time. 
The BJP recorded a significant increase in vote share, rising from 38.5% in 2020 to 45.56% in 2025. Meanwhile, AAP’s vote share declined from 53.6% to 43.57%, signalling a major shift in Delhi’s political landscape.

"After drubbing AAP in Delhi, 'Bangal cholo' next for BJP?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-drubbing-aap-in-delhi-bangla-chalo-next-for-bjp/articleshow/118116026.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"PTI photo (File)
 
NEW DELHI: Since 2014, the BJP has been moving from one poll victory to another -- both on the national as well as the state level -- with seemingly nothing able to stand in the way of the Modi wave. 
However, one thorn in BJP's side was Delhi, where the Arvind Kejriwal-led fortress managed to survive the saffron tsunami not once, but twice.
However, 2025 proved to be a breakthrough year as the BJP broke the 27-year-old jinx to storm back to power in the Capital. It defeated the indomitable Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) by winning 48 seats in the 70-member Delhi assembly.
Bristling with confidence after acquiring the Rajdhani in the North, the party has already given clear indications that its next mission is to make inroads in the eastern state of West Bengal.
Like Delhi, making inroads in the Mamata Banerjee-ruled Bengal has been an uphill task for the BJP for the past two assembly elections.
In the 2016 assembly elections, buoyed by the majority mandate at the Centre, the BJP expected to emerge as a key party but faced an embarrassing defeat. The party won only 3 seats in the 294-seat West Bengal assembly.
In 2019, the BJP came back to power at the Centre with an even bigger mandate and by then had a decent presence in even the northeastern states, where BJP had negligible presence before 2014.
Two years down the line, the party made another attempt to breach the fortress of Mamata Banerjee but to no avail. 
In 2021, when the results trickled in, the BJP won only 77 seats with TMC winning a whopping mandate by securing victory on 215 seats. Though the BJP vote and seat share improved substantially, it was far less than the 200-seat mark the party had expected to win in the polls.
Just like Delhi in 2015 and 2020, the BJP fell flat in Bengal in 2016 and 2021.
However, with the BJP finally triumphing in Delhi, Bengal BJP leaders now see the possibility that Bengal may not be ""mission impossible"" anymore.
As BJP was celebrating its victory in the Capital on February 8, its top Bengal leader Suvendu Adhikari shot off a salvo at CM Mamata Banerjee, saying after the national capital, Bengal would vote for the BJP by uprooting ruling TMC.
""Delhi ki jeet hamari hai ... 2026 mein Bengal ki baari hai … (Delhi's victory is ours ... in 2026 it will be Bengal's turn),"" Adhikari said while reacting to BJP's massive comeback after 27 years of political exile.
Pumped by the BJP's historic win in Delhi, Bengal BJP chief and Union minister Sukanta Majumdar said Delhi's victory would serve as a morale booster for party workers in West Bengal ahead of next year's assembly elections.
BJP's Amit Malviya, who heads the party's I-T department, said that ""jitters from the Delhi results are being felt in West Bengal"" and claimed that ""nervous"" Mamata Banerjee would go solo in next year's assembly polls.
""A nervous Mamata Banerjee has told TMC MLAs that there will be NO alliance in Bengal … It is not surprising that she applies a different yardstick to the opposition in Haryana and Delhi but is unwilling to cede space for the alliance at home,"" Malviya wrote on X.

"No discontent in Punjab AAP, asserts Bhagwant Mann; all MLAs attend Delhi meet",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-discontent-in-punjab-aap-asserts-bhagwant-mann-all-mlas-attend-delhi-meet/articleshow/118157908.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"NEW DELHI: Punjab CM 
Bhagwant Mann
 on Tuesday dismissed claims by Congress and BJP of unrest brewing among AAP MLAs, tamping down speculation that the ripples from AAP's Delhi debacle may pose a risk to his govt.
Talking to reporters after the surprise move of party boss Arvind Kejriwal to summon Punjab CM, ministers, MPs and MLAs to Delhi, Mann took on Congress and said ""switching sides is Congress's culture"" and reminded Partap Singh Bajwa, the leader of opposition in Punjab, that his party drew a blank in Delhi.
Ahead of the meeting, which AAP said was attended by all 92 Punjab MLAs, Bajwa had alleged that the party was preparing the ground to oust Mann from the CM's post. He had also claimed that over 30 AAP MLAs were in touch with his party. 
Meeting sparks speculation about instability in 
Punjab AAP
 Instead of counting our MLAs, he should see how many Congress candidates won in Delhi,"" Bhagwant Mann said. Kejriwal and other senior functionaries held a meeting with Punjab functionaries to ostensibly thank them for their involvement in Delhi campaign.
According to AAP, the meeting at Kapurthala House saw all MLAs from Punjab and MPs from the state come together in what the party projected as a show of solidarity and normalcy amid the gloom of the Delhi loss. Besides Kejriwal and former deputy CM Manish Sisodia, national organisational secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Sandeep Pathak and RS MP Raghav Chadha were present.
Kejriwal is learnt to have asked the Punjab MLAs to reconnect with voters while working unitedly to pave the way for AAP's return to office in 2027. The timing of the meeting following AAP's defeat in Delhi had sparked speculation about instability in the party's Punjab unit. Asked about Bajwa's allegation that he could quit AAP with a group of MLAs, Mann said, ""Let them say so. We cultivated the party with hard work by going to every nook and corner of the state. They don't worry about their own party and find fault with others. It is Congress that has a culture of switching parties.""
BJP's newly-elected Rajouri Garden MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa claimed Mann's ""nervousness and body language"" after the meeting ""supports the conspiracy theory"" that he had spoken of on Monday. Sirsa had alleged that Kejriwal was scripting a narrative to oust Mann. 
AAP's estranged RS MP Swati Maliwal also took a dig at Kejriwal and said, ""Some people have started treating Punjab as their personal ATM. Today, massive corruption is rampant in Punjab.""

NEW DELHI: Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann on Tuesday responded to Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa's claim that 30 Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs were in contact with him. 
""Pratap Singh Bajwa has been saying this for almost three years. Let him say whatever he wants. I would ask Pratap Singh Bajwa to count how many MLAs they (Congress) have in Delhi,"" Mann told reporters. 
Mann also said, ""He (Bajwa) has been making claims earlier also that 20 MLAs or 40 MLAs are in touch with him. Let them say it. We have formed this party with our sweat and blood, going among people in villages and towns in the state.""
Poll
Do you agree with the claim made by Congress?
No, it's just political talk
Yes, it seems likely
After AAP's loss in the Delhi assembly elections, Bajwa claimed that an internal struggle would start between Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann and AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal. He also said that over 30 AAP MLAs were in contact with the Congress and were ready to switch sides. 
Congress MP Pramod Tiwari, however, denied that AAP MLAs were in touch with either the BJP or Congress. He said Congress does not support breaking other parties but is observing the political situation in Punjab. 
""BJP has a history of horse-trading and breaking parties—we have seen this in Maharashtra, Goa, Manipur also. They will try to do this in Punjab as well. As far as Congress is concerned, we do not believe in breaking parties. Our party's state leadership is monitoring the situation over there,"" Tiwari said while talking to news agency ANI. 
Earlier in the day, Mann arrived at Kapurthala House in New Delhi for a meeting with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal amid reports of differences within AAP. 
""Our MLAs reached here, and we had a meeting with party national convenor Arvind Kejriwal. He thanked them all for campaigning during the Delhi Assembly elections. Our government in Punjab has always worked for public welfare, whether in education or infrastructure. We need to speed up… Winning and losing is a part of the game. People of Delhi still remember us as someone who worked for them. We have two years more in Punjab. We will make Punjab a good model,"" Mann told the media. 
AAP, which had ruled Delhi for ten years, won only 22 out of 70 seats in the February 5 elections, while the BJP secured a majority, ending AAP's rule in the capital. 
There is also speculation that Kejriwal may take a bigger role in Punjab politics, with discussions about him contesting the vacant Ludhiana Assembly seat. However, AAP MP Malvinder Singh Kang dismissed these reports, calling the meeting a ""routine strategy session."" 
Meanwhile, BJP leader Rohini Vijender Gupta criticized AAP, saying the party is struggling after its defeat in the Delhi elections. 
""Kejriwal is doing a meeting, but it is a sinking ship. They are trying to keep their people together...but it will not last long,"" Gupta said.

This is how BJP celebrated Delhi poll victory in Parliament,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/bjp-celebrates-delhi-poll-victory-with-modi-modi-chants-in-parliament/articleshow/118126100.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"NEW DELHI: BJP's victory in the Delhi polls was hailed by NDA members with chanting of ""Modi, Modi"" slogan in both houses of Parliament on Monday, while former Union minister Anurag Thakur took a jibe at Rahul Gandhi in Lok Sabha over Congress's dismal performance in elections in the capital over the years.
BJP members in Rajya Sabha also ridiculed AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal for having once said that PM Modi would have to be reborn to unseat AAP in Delhi. They also stated that ""people had shown the mirror to those living in Sheesh Mahal"".
Soon after Lok Sabha proceedings started, BJP MPs raised the slogan, to which Congress MPs objected. The sloganeering went on for a while before Speaker Om Birla called for the question hour.
Taking a jibe Rahul in Lok Sabha, Thakur said, ""Rahul Ji, zero check kar lijiye... (Rahul, please check the zero) as Congress has consecutively secured zero seats third time in a row. Referring to Congress' poor track record, he said, ""How many seats did people of Delhi give to Congress in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections? Zero. In 2015? Zero. In 2019? Zero. In 2020? Zero. In 2024? Zero. And in 2025? Zero.""
When proceedings of the upper house began, BJP members started sloganeering in support of PM Modi. However, sloganeering was paused for a while when Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar extended birthday greetings to BJP's Sanjay Seth. It again started, with BJP MPs chanting ""Delhi ke dil me Modi hai, Desh ke dil me Modi hai"".
Meanwhile, BJP MP from Maharashtra Medha Vishram Kulkarni, while praising the budget, referred to its impact in Delhi polls, saying, ""People showed a mirror to those living in Sheesh Mahal.""
Quoting a Hindi couplet, BJP MP Dinesh Sharma, without naming Kejriwal, said his haughtiness got a befitting answer in AAP's stinging defeat. ""The defeat came in this very birth,"" he quipped.
Meanwhile in Lok Sabha, Thakur questioned Congress leaders for not taking a holy dip during the Maha Kumbh and wondered if they had been directed not to do so by ""Uncle Soros and Uncle Sam."" Thakur said even former PM Jawaharlal Nehru took a dip in the Sangam but today's generation of the Congress is avoiding it.

Winning over Jats: How BJP scored a perfect 10 in Delhi elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/winning-over-jats-how-bjp-scored-a-perfect-10/articleshow/118126209.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"A notable win was Parvesh Verma's, which consolidated Jat youth support. Dissatisfaction with AAP's handling of rural problems and a lack of Jat representation in the INDIA bloc also contributed to BJP's success.
 
NEW DELHI: The BJP swept all 10 Jat-dominated constituencies in Delhi into its kitty, capturing territory that they did not have in the last two elections.
Party officials attributed the strong Jat support for the BJP to several factors, particularly the party's focus on addressing rural problems and its willingness to give tickets to several Jat functionaries.
A senior BJP functionary said that there were several problems in Jat-dominated areas, such as registries, a crumbling civic infrastructure, and a need for better connectivity. ""Through DDA and with the support of the lieutenant governor, some work was done. The Jats realised that central govt assistance could play a key role in their development, which was not happening,"" the BJP source said.
Days before the elections, the representatives from all 360 villages of Delhi declared their backing for BJP. Their decision stemmed from a general dissatisfaction with Delhi govt for its failure to resolve issues affecting rural communities.
Another BJP functionary said that giving a ticket to Parvesh Verma also helped, as it led to the consolidation of the community, especially the youth, in BJP's favour. 
He said the bitter political confrontation, when AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal called Verma a traitor for giving money to women through his NGO before the model code of conduct kicked in, also did not help AAP. ""When Kejriwal made personal statements targeting Parvesh Verma through his press briefings, he often made it a Jat issue as well,"" the BJP functionary said.
Also, when Verma was pitched against Kejriwal, it made the contest a battle of personalities, which led to a strong Jat backing for BJP. The BJP also swept outer Delhi seats, which were once the stronghold of his father and former chief minister Sahib Singh Verma.
Another functionary said that having senior Jat functionaries contesting the polls helped in different ways. When AAP raised the issue of Jat reservation, these functionaries were quick to respond that if the party was serious then it should have first brought the proposal in the Vidhan Sabha when it was ruling, but it never did. ""The voices got amplified,"" he said.
Paramjeet Sejwal, who lives in Lado Sarai, said: ""There were several reasons for the BJP's gain. The crumbling infrastructure when not much was happening on the development front was one. Second, people in the community saw leaders such as Kailash Gahlot leaving. Also, the INDIA bloc did not give any ticket to people from the Jat community. So, these factors started consolidating after a point.""
In Lado Sarai, which is part of the Jat-influenced seat of Mehrauli, Gajendra Yadav of BJP won by 1,786 votes. The margins in other seats were larger. In the Jat-dominated seat of Najafgarh, Neelam Pahalwan of BJP won by 29,009 votes against Tarun Kumar of AAP. Last time, AAP got 72,699 votes in this seat.
Gahlot, a former AAP govt minister who switched sides before the polls, won by 11,276 votes against Surendra Bharadwaj of AAP.
In the Palam constituency, a key seat where Jats are in significant numbers, Kuldeep Solanki of BJP won by a margin of 8,952 votes against Joginder Solanki of AAP. The AAP polled 73,094 votes in this seat.
In Nangloi Jat, Manoj Kumar Shokeen of BJP won against Raghuvinder Shokeen of AAP by a margin of 26,251 votes. The party won Narela by 8,596 votes, Rithala by 29,616, Mundka by 10,550 and Nangloi Jat by 26,251. In Vikaspuri, Matiala and Palam also , BJP got good winning margins.

The report is expected to shed light on various issues including irregularities in excise policy, renovation of former CM's residence, and education policies.

The Delhi assembly's first session will begin on February 24, where MLAs will take their oath and elect a new Speaker.
""The report will be tabled in the House and many things will come to light. I think the truth will come out in the CAG report. Whether it is education, liquor, or Sheesh Mahal, many such issues will be raised in the House,"" said Khurana.
Khurana criticized AAP for not presenting the report earlier, emphasizing that the new BJP-led government would operate according to constitutional norms.
""The 8th assembly formed yesterday and its first session will begin tomorrow with the oath of the MLAs and the election of the Speaker and the next day the CAG report will be tabled. This report should have been tabled in the 7th Assembly, as per the rules. But now whatever work the Delhi government will do will be done as per the rules, as per the Constitution,"" Khurana stated.
AAP's national spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar responded by questioning BJP's commitment to their campaign promises, particularly regarding the Rs 2,500 financial assistance scheme for Delhi women.
""BJP should display optimistic politics. They should work on the promises they made to the people of Delhi instead of imposing their agenda. They said that in the first cabinet meeting, a resolution would be passed that every woman in Delhi would get Rs 2500 per month in her account,"" Kakkar said.
Kakkar pointed out that BJP had not addressed their promises in their first cabinet meeting, contrasting this with AAP's record of fulfilling their commitments when they came to power.

MSRTC workers' union said the security of bus drivers and conductors is now at stake.
On Saturday, the MSRTC cancelled 250 buses that operate between Maharashtra and Karnataka in the wake of the violence. Six of these buses operate from Pune. Abhijit Bhosle, the MSRTC public relations officer, said it is not certain whether the buses would operate on Sunday. ""We will take a call after consultation with police. At this moment, nothing can be said,"" the official told TOI. 
As the MSRTC buses towards Karnataka did not ply on Saturday, more than 20 buses from the Kolhapur Central bus stand were cancelled. Passengers were stranded at the bus stand.
Shiv Sena (UBT) workers protested against the incident at the Kolhapur Central bus stand on Saturday morning. They put up saffron flags on the Karnataka State Road Transport buses and raised slogans against the Karnataka govt. Shahupuri police detained the Shiv Sena (UBT) workers.
Vijay Dewane, the district convenor of Shiv Sena (UBT), said, ""The Maharashtra chief minister should immediately stop all the Karnataka buses from entering our state. Karnataka govt should apologise for this act, else a befitting reply will be given.""
The Maharashtra-Karnataka border dispute has been going on for several years now. Whenever the border dispute flares up, the first to bear the brunt often are the state transport buses. 
MSRTC bus conductor Prashant Thorat, who was in the bus that was attacked on Friday, said, ""Our driver, Bhaskar Jadhav, was driving the Bengaluru-Pune MSRTC bus from Chitradurga to Kolhapur when, around 9.30pm, activists of the Karnataka Navanirman Sene turned up in four to five vehicles and blocked the way. The activists, carrying red-yellow flags and scarves, the Jadhav if he could speak in Kannada. When the driver said no, he was pulled out of the bus. His face was blackened. The activists raised slogans screaming ‘If you can't speak Kannada, then you will not be allowed into Karnataka'. Black ink was also splashed on the bus. This continued for half an hour. Our bus was stranded there till 4 am and we, including all the passengers, were very scared as we didn't know the Kannada language either."" 
Repercussions of this incident are now likely to be felt in parts of Maharashtra as well. Uttam Patil, the divisional secretary of the MSRTC workers' union, said, ""There should be coordination between the two states regarding interstate traffic. The number of passengers travelling from Maharashtra to Karnataka is huge. If the corporation takes responsibility for the safety of drivers and conductors, we have no problem in going to Karnataka. MSRTC drivers and the general public are being dragged into the organisational and political tussle. The transport corporations of both states should sit together and decide on safety.""

Speaking about the move, deputy CM Sharma expressed that prisoners also have the desire to partake in the sacred tradition of

""This decision comes from the cultural values rooted in us and is an integral part of our traditions. The initiative is aimed at fostering a sense of self-purification and morality among prisoners, while also promoting their rehabilitation and reform,"" said Sharma. 
Sharma added that this spiritual event is taking place during the grand Maha Kumbh, a rare occasion occurring once every 144 years, and that everyone, including inmates, has the right to benefit from such a divine opportunity. In order to ensure the event runs smoothly, Sharma stated that necessary instructions have been provided to all jail superintendents and officials involved.
 Sharma emphasized that such programmes will continue to be organized, giving prisoners the opportunity to reintegrate into society and lead a reformed life.

"Amid Tamil Nadu row, PM Modi says it's 'our duty to embrace all languages'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amid-tamil-nadu-row-pm-modi-says-its-our-duty-to-embrace-all-languages/articleshow/118461786.cms,Tamil Nadu,General News,"NEW DELHI: Amid DMK leaders' declaration that they were ready for a language war in protest against the 
three-language formula
, PM 
Narendra Modi
 on Friday said there has never been any animosity among 
Indian languages
 and each has enriched the other.
Addressing the inaugural function of the 98th Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan in New Delhi, Modi said when efforts were made to create divisions based on languages, India's shared linguistic heritage gave a fitting reply. ""It is our social responsibility to distance ourselves from these misconceptions and embrace and enrich all languages,"" the PM added.
His remarks came on a day when 
Tamil Nadu
 CM M K Stalin reiterated his stand that implementation of the National Education Policy, 2020, was an attempt to impose a three-language formula throughout the country and said the state would stick to its two-language system.
The PM, meanwhile, said while languages were born in society, they also played a crucial role in shaping it. ""Language is not just a medium of communication but a carrier of our culture,"" he said, adding that today, all languages in the country were viewed as mainstream languages.
Modi highlighted that India was one of world's oldest living civilisations because it had consistently evolved, embraced new ideas, and welcomed changes. Pointing out that India's vast linguistic diversity was a testament to this evolution and served as a fundamental basis for unity, he compared language to a mother who imparted new and vast knowledge to her children without discrimination.
Modi also referred to efforts to promote education in all major languages and added that the mindset of neglecting talent due to the lack of English proficiency had changed.

Bail for accused in Rs 4 crore Raipur crypto scam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bail-for-accused-in-rs-4-crore-raipur-crypto-scam/articleshow/118368541.cms,Chhattisgarh,Raipur,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday granted bail to an accused in a Rs 4 crore crypto currency scam in Raipur, in which around 2,000 investors lost their monies, and asked the accused, Subhelal, to deposit Rs 35 lakh as security deposit within six months.
""We are conscious of the fact that we have been condemning the High Courts when they impose such conditions. But here is a case wherein we are compelled to impose such conditions having regard to the peculiar facts of this case,"" said a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan in its judgment.
""We make it clear that within the time period of six months, if the amount is not deposited by the appellant, this bail shall stand automatically cancelled,"" the bench said, while noting that the accused has been in jail since Dec 2023 and that the prosecution proposed to examine 189 witnesses of which examination of the first one is going on.
The bench examined the factual situations in which a court can grant bail to an accused. It said if the role of the accused cannot be attributed to delay in trial, if there is no apprehension of him tampering with evidence or chances of him absconding, then the trial court can grant him bail.
In case after case relating to grant of bail, the SC had been deprecating practice in the HCs to seek monetary security deposit from the accused if he was to enjoy the relief. In one such appeal case, it had said, ""Inclusion of a condition for payment of money by the applicant for bail tends to create an impression that bail could be secured by depositing money alleged to have been cheated. That is really not the purpose and intent of the provisions for grant of bail.""
Justices Pardiwala and Mahadevan said since it is an economic offence, it is not undermining the seriousness of the alleged crime and since the role of the accused is estimated to the tune of defrauding Rs 35 lakh, it was asking him to deposit that much money while granting him bail.

"Chennai cops forget drug scale, weigh ganja like bananas; court throws out case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chennai-cops-forget-drug-scale-weigh-ganja-like-bananas-court-throws-out-case/articleshow/118368392.cms,Tamil Nadu,Chennai,"CHENNAI: A man accused of smuggling ganja recently walked free after a city court threw out the case as Chennai police had borrowed a fruit vendor's weighing scales to measure the narcotic seized instead of using their own equipment as mandated by law.
Sub-Inspector Palani, who led the raid, initially reported to his superiors that his team had the necessary weighing machine. However, in court, he admitted under cross-examination that they had used a shop's scales. The result: Ashok Kumar alias 'Kakka' Kumar walked free. The seizure took place on Nov 11, 2019, at LGN Road-Gopal Dass Road junction following a tip-off that Kumar was in possession of ganja. Police searched him in the fruit market and claimed to have seized 1.5kg of ganja.
After the seizure, 50 grams of ganja were sent to a forensic lab, while the remaining quantity was packed and sealed. However, police took 61 days to submit the seized narcotic to the court, raising doubts about the integrity of its handling. The NDPS Act mandates that police should carry their own weighing machines, testing kits, and packing materials to ensure proper evidence collection at the scene of seizure. The trial court cited contradictions in the prosecution's evidence and ruled in favour of the accused. Principal Special Judge S Hermies found the recovery process unreliable and dismissed the case.
This isn't an isolated case - Chennai police have repeatedly skipped carrying weighing machines, leading to acquittals. During a trial in the same court last Oct, Kilpauk police borrowed a shop's scales to weigh two kg of ganja seized near Ega Theatre. 
""Police and customs measure exact weights only in major seizures (in tonnes) at transit hubs such as airports or ports. In other cases, they record a convenient figure at the station, a practice defence lawyers often challenge in court,"" alleged advocate R Gopi.

West Bengal CM
 Mamata Banerjee said in the assembly on Tuesday, countering BJP's allegations.
""I was accused of disrespecting Hinduism and supporting Muslim League. After all my struggles, I have to hear that I have links with terrorists from J&K and Bangladesh. I will write to the PM, and if he can prove any link with terrorists, I will step down as CM,"" she said as her party colleagues chanted ""Shame, Shame)"" in unison. Banerjee added, ""There is no place for mafia in Bengal. We do not harbour terrorists or rioters. It's better to die than to be accused of having ties with terrorists."" Her comments were in response to allegations made by leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikai outside the House on Monday after his 30-day suspension. 
A privilege motion was moved in the assembly against Adhikari for his comments on Tuesday even as BJP MLAs boycotted the session.
Addressing Adhikari, the CM said, ""I saw the video of what you said outside the assembly yesterday. You claimed you were expelled for speaking about Hinduism. Since when did you become a leader of Hinduism?"" She added, ""You (BJP) sell religion to divide the country. We do not. Remember that because we believe in democracy in Bengal, that everyone is allowed to speak. But we will not tolerate division in the name of religion.""
Responding to BJP's allegations of two holidays on the occasion of Shab-e-Barat, the CM said the party in opposition raises questions but does not have the courage to listen to answers, which is why they were not present in the House. ""One leave was for Shab-e-Barat and the other to mark the birth anniversary of Panchanan Barma,"" she said, adding, ""You need the Rajbangshis for votes but won't respect their leader and tradition.""

Although Congress improved its tally from 1 to 11, BJP won the JMC election comfortably, winning 48 of the 60 seats, with one seat bagged by an Independent.

"CEC appointment: BJP's Dharmendra Pradhan strikes back at Congress, says 'rules not broken'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cec-appointment-bjps-dharmendra-pradhan-strikes-back-at-congress-says-rules-not-broken/articleshow/118367870.cms,Madhya Pradesh,Dhar,"NEW DELHI: 
BJP
 on Tuesday attacked LoP in Lok Sabha 
Rahul Gandhi
 for opposing the appointment of Gyanesh Kumar as the 
chief election commissioner
 and Vivek Joshi as election commissioner, saying the 
Congress
 MP's note of dissent was politically motivated and lacked merit.
""This latest move by Rahul Gandhi is another attempt to create controversy and peddle propaganda about the CEC's appointment. Has Rahul Gandhi forgotten how ECs were appointed during Congress rule? Despite being in power for decades, why did Congress govts do nothing to reform the selection mechanism?"" Union minister 
Dharmendra Pradhan
 said on X. He said successive govts appointed their nominee as CEC and did not care to follow the Constitution's directive to constitute a collegium. ""It is our govt that has created a joint system for the appointment of CEC and EC, which includes the leader of the opposition. It is a great misfortune that Rahul Gandhi and Congress are acting like cry babies even when no rule/law is broken,"" Pradhan said.
The minister also questioned Rahul invoking the Constitution and B R Ambedkar to make his case. ""Congress never missed an opportunity to ridicule and insult Baba Saheb Ambedkar, yet the 'yuvraj' of Congress (Rahul Gandhi) has the audacity to take a grandstand on upholding Baba Saheb's ideals and those of our founding leaders,"" he said.
BJP IT department head Amit Malviya referenced the March 2, 2023, ruling by a five-judge constitution bench, which revised the appointment process to include recommendations from a committee comprising the PM, LoP, and CJI, but only until Parliament legislated otherwise. Malviya said the appointment process is ""more structured, transparent and inclusive,"" involving multiple stakeholders, including the LoP.
On the appointment process, he said a search committee, led by the law minister (currently Arjun Ram Meghwal) and two senior bureaucrats, shortlisted five candidates and the list was sent to a selection committee.

Kolkata man gets death for 7-month-old’s rape,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kolkata-man-gets-death-for-7-month-olds-rape/articleshow/118367644.cms,West Bengal,Kolkata,"KOLKATA: A Pocso court in Kolkata on Tuesday sentenced a 34-year-old man to death for raping a seven-month-old infant on Nov 30 last year and leaving her fighting for life, terming the case ""rarest of rare"".
""There cannot be any other punishment that the court can think of,"" judge Indrila Mukherjee Mitra said in her verdict against 
Rajib Ghosh
, alias Gobra, a day after he was held guilty. Special public prosecutor Bivas Chatterjee described the order as ""historic"" for Bengal's judicial system. 
""This is because we have not seen the death sentence given in such cases until now. In this case, the girl survived,"" Chatterjee said.
The prosecutor had sought death. ""The defence lawyer repeatedly argued whether we could seek the death penalty since the girl survived. The law, however, does not state that the victim must die to pronounce a death sentence,"" Chatterjee argued.
The sentencing comes less than three months - within 80 days - of the crime. The court also awarded compensation of Rs 10 lakh for the baby, who continues to be critical in RG Kar Hospital for over two months amid assessments that she would be left with permanent damage.
Ghosh had raped the infant after kidnapping her from a pavement in Kolkata's Burtolla area where she had been sleeping beside her mother on late in the night of Nov 30.

On Sunday morning, banners bearing images of deceased Hamas leaders Ismail Haniyeh and Yahya Sinwar, and Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah, also deceased, were displayed by a group of people during a procession during Desholsavam, a local cultural festival.
BJP organised protest events across Palakkad while the party's state unit demanded the state govt act strongly, even as Congress alleged the saffron party was communalising the issue. BJP approached the police with a complaint but a case is yet to be registered.
The procession, featuring elephants, performers and musical groups, marked the final day of the week-long festival in which people from all walks of life, regardless of faith and political affiliation, took part. The yearly gathering coincides with the annual offering (Aandu Nercha) at a nearby mosque (Jaaram) in the locality, although the mosque administration is not directly associated with the festivities. Three separate boards featuring Hamas and Hezbollah men were displayed by individuals positioned on three elephants.
""During past festivals, boards featuring international leaders like Yasser Arafat and Che Guevara were exhibited, reflecting the contemporary issues of those times. The latest boards correspond to the ongoing discussions on the Palestine-Israel conflict. The matter holds no communal significance,"" said festival committee president Muhammed Koppath, also a Congress worker.
Festival committee secretary KP Sreenivasan, a local CPM neta, said: ""The fest is a secular gathering. We noticed the boards only when the visuals went viral. It was done by one of the groups and not with the committee's consent.""
Local BJP worker Unnikrishnan Mezhathoor alleged that a group of people with extremist links was behind the incident and Congress and CPM were supporting them in hope of votes in Muslim-majority assembly segment.
BJP state president K Surendran has already demanded action against the organisers. 
Congress functionary VT Balram said Sangh Parivar was using the issue for its anti-Muslim hate campaigns.

"After drubbing AAP in Delhi, 'Bangal cholo' next for BJP?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-drubbing-aap-in-delhi-bangla-chalo-next-for-bjp/articleshow/118116026.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"PTI photo (File)
 
NEW DELHI: Since 2014, the BJP has been moving from one poll victory to another -- both on the national as well as the state level -- with seemingly nothing able to stand in the way of the Modi wave. 
However, one thorn in BJP's side was Delhi, where the Arvind Kejriwal-led fortress managed to survive the saffron tsunami not once, but twice.
However, 2025 proved to be a breakthrough year as the BJP broke the 27-year-old jinx to storm back to power in the Capital. It defeated the indomitable Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) by winning 48 seats in the 70-member Delhi assembly.
Bristling with confidence after acquiring the Rajdhani in the North, the party has already given clear indications that its next mission is to make inroads in the eastern state of West Bengal.
Like Delhi, making inroads in the Mamata Banerjee-ruled Bengal has been an uphill task for the BJP for the past two assembly elections.
In the 2016 assembly elections, buoyed by the majority mandate at the Centre, the BJP expected to emerge as a key party but faced an embarrassing defeat. The party won only 3 seats in the 294-seat West Bengal assembly.
In 2019, the BJP came back to power at the Centre with an even bigger mandate and by then had a decent presence in even the northeastern states, where BJP had negligible presence before 2014.
Two years down the line, the party made another attempt to breach the fortress of Mamata Banerjee but to no avail. 
In 2021, when the results trickled in, the BJP won only 77 seats with TMC winning a whopping mandate by securing victory on 215 seats. Though the BJP vote and seat share improved substantially, it was far less than the 200-seat mark the party had expected to win in the polls.
Just like Delhi in 2015 and 2020, the BJP fell flat in Bengal in 2016 and 2021.
However, with the BJP finally triumphing in Delhi, Bengal BJP leaders now see the possibility that Bengal may not be ""mission impossible"" anymore.
As BJP was celebrating its victory in the Capital on February 8, its top Bengal leader Suvendu Adhikari shot off a salvo at CM Mamata Banerjee, saying after the national capital, Bengal would vote for the BJP by uprooting ruling TMC.
""Delhi ki jeet hamari hai ... 2026 mein Bengal ki baari hai … (Delhi's victory is ours ... in 2026 it will be Bengal's turn),"" Adhikari said while reacting to BJP's massive comeback after 27 years of political exile.
Pumped by the BJP's historic win in Delhi, Bengal BJP chief and Union minister Sukanta Majumdar said Delhi's victory would serve as a morale booster for party workers in West Bengal ahead of next year's assembly elections.
BJP's Amit Malviya, who heads the party's I-T department, said that ""jitters from the Delhi results are being felt in West Bengal"" and claimed that ""nervous"" Mamata Banerjee would go solo in next year's assembly polls.
""A nervous Mamata Banerjee has told TMC MLAs that there will be NO alliance in Bengal … It is not surprising that she applies a different yardstick to the opposition in Haryana and Delhi but is unwilling to cede space for the alliance at home,"" Malviya wrote on X.

"No discontent in Punjab AAP, asserts Bhagwant Mann; all MLAs attend Delhi meet",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-discontent-in-punjab-aap-asserts-bhagwant-mann-all-mlas-attend-delhi-meet/articleshow/118157908.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"NEW DELHI: Punjab CM 
Bhagwant Mann
 on Tuesday dismissed claims by Congress and BJP of unrest brewing among AAP MLAs, tamping down speculation that the ripples from AAP's Delhi debacle may pose a risk to his govt.
Talking to reporters after the surprise move of party boss Arvind Kejriwal to summon Punjab CM, ministers, MPs and MLAs to Delhi, Mann took on Congress and said ""switching sides is Congress's culture"" and reminded Partap Singh Bajwa, the leader of opposition in Punjab, that his party drew a blank in Delhi.
Ahead of the meeting, which AAP said was attended by all 92 Punjab MLAs, Bajwa had alleged that the party was preparing the ground to oust Mann from the CM's post. He had also claimed that over 30 AAP MLAs were in touch with his party. 
Meeting sparks speculation about instability in 
Punjab AAP
 Instead of counting our MLAs, he should see how many Congress candidates won in Delhi,"" Bhagwant Mann said. Kejriwal and other senior functionaries held a meeting with Punjab functionaries to ostensibly thank them for their involvement in Delhi campaign.
According to AAP, the meeting at Kapurthala House saw all MLAs from Punjab and MPs from the state come together in what the party projected as a show of solidarity and normalcy amid the gloom of the Delhi loss. Besides Kejriwal and former deputy CM Manish Sisodia, national organisational secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Sandeep Pathak and RS MP Raghav Chadha were present.
Kejriwal is learnt to have asked the Punjab MLAs to reconnect with voters while working unitedly to pave the way for AAP's return to office in 2027. The timing of the meeting following AAP's defeat in Delhi had sparked speculation about instability in the party's Punjab unit. Asked about Bajwa's allegation that he could quit AAP with a group of MLAs, Mann said, ""Let them say so. We cultivated the party with hard work by going to every nook and corner of the state. They don't worry about their own party and find fault with others. It is Congress that has a culture of switching parties.""
BJP's newly-elected Rajouri Garden MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa claimed Mann's ""nervousness and body language"" after the meeting ""supports the conspiracy theory"" that he had spoken of on Monday. Sirsa had alleged that Kejriwal was scripting a narrative to oust Mann. 
AAP's estranged RS MP Swati Maliwal also took a dig at Kejriwal and said, ""Some people have started treating Punjab as their personal ATM. Today, massive corruption is rampant in Punjab.""

NEW DELHI: Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann on Tuesday responded to Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa's claim that 30 Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs were in contact with him. 
""Pratap Singh Bajwa has been saying this for almost three years. Let him say whatever he wants. I would ask Pratap Singh Bajwa to count how many MLAs they (Congress) have in Delhi,"" Mann told reporters. 
Mann also said, ""He (Bajwa) has been making claims earlier also that 20 MLAs or 40 MLAs are in touch with him. Let them say it. We have formed this party with our sweat and blood, going among people in villages and towns in the state.""
Poll
Do you agree with the claim made by Congress?
No, it's just political talk
Yes, it seems likely
After AAP's loss in the Delhi assembly elections, Bajwa claimed that an internal struggle would start between Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann and AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal. He also said that over 30 AAP MLAs were in contact with the Congress and were ready to switch sides. 
Congress MP Pramod Tiwari, however, denied that AAP MLAs were in touch with either the BJP or Congress. He said Congress does not support breaking other parties but is observing the political situation in Punjab. 
""BJP has a history of horse-trading and breaking parties—we have seen this in Maharashtra, Goa, Manipur also. They will try to do this in Punjab as well. As far as Congress is concerned, we do not believe in breaking parties. Our party's state leadership is monitoring the situation over there,"" Tiwari said while talking to news agency ANI. 
Earlier in the day, Mann arrived at Kapurthala House in New Delhi for a meeting with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal amid reports of differences within AAP. 
""Our MLAs reached here, and we had a meeting with party national convenor Arvind Kejriwal. He thanked them all for campaigning during the Delhi Assembly elections. Our government in Punjab has always worked for public welfare, whether in education or infrastructure. We need to speed up… Winning and losing is a part of the game. People of Delhi still remember us as someone who worked for them. We have two years more in Punjab. We will make Punjab a good model,"" Mann told the media. 
AAP, which had ruled Delhi for ten years, won only 22 out of 70 seats in the February 5 elections, while the BJP secured a majority, ending AAP's rule in the capital. 
There is also speculation that Kejriwal may take a bigger role in Punjab politics, with discussions about him contesting the vacant Ludhiana Assembly seat. However, AAP MP Malvinder Singh Kang dismissed these reports, calling the meeting a ""routine strategy session."" 
Meanwhile, BJP leader Rohini Vijender Gupta criticized AAP, saying the party is struggling after its defeat in the Delhi elections. 
""Kejriwal is doing a meeting, but it is a sinking ship. They are trying to keep their people together...but it will not last long,"" Gupta said.

This is how BJP celebrated Delhi poll victory in Parliament,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/bjp-celebrates-delhi-poll-victory-with-modi-modi-chants-in-parliament/articleshow/118126100.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"NEW DELHI: BJP's victory in the Delhi polls was hailed by NDA members with chanting of ""Modi, Modi"" slogan in both houses of Parliament on Monday, while former Union minister Anurag Thakur took a jibe at Rahul Gandhi in Lok Sabha over Congress's dismal performance in elections in the capital over the years.
BJP members in Rajya Sabha also ridiculed AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal for having once said that PM Modi would have to be reborn to unseat AAP in Delhi. They also stated that ""people had shown the mirror to those living in Sheesh Mahal"".
Soon after Lok Sabha proceedings started, BJP MPs raised the slogan, to which Congress MPs objected. The sloganeering went on for a while before Speaker Om Birla called for the question hour.
Taking a jibe Rahul in Lok Sabha, Thakur said, ""Rahul Ji, zero check kar lijiye... (Rahul, please check the zero) as Congress has consecutively secured zero seats third time in a row. Referring to Congress' poor track record, he said, ""How many seats did people of Delhi give to Congress in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections? Zero. In 2015? Zero. In 2019? Zero. In 2020? Zero. In 2024? Zero. And in 2025? Zero.""
When proceedings of the upper house began, BJP members started sloganeering in support of PM Modi. However, sloganeering was paused for a while when Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar extended birthday greetings to BJP's Sanjay Seth. It again started, with BJP MPs chanting ""Delhi ke dil me Modi hai, Desh ke dil me Modi hai"".
Meanwhile, BJP MP from Maharashtra Medha Vishram Kulkarni, while praising the budget, referred to its impact in Delhi polls, saying, ""People showed a mirror to those living in Sheesh Mahal.""
Quoting a Hindi couplet, BJP MP Dinesh Sharma, without naming Kejriwal, said his haughtiness got a befitting answer in AAP's stinging defeat. ""The defeat came in this very birth,"" he quipped.
Meanwhile in Lok Sabha, Thakur questioned Congress leaders for not taking a holy dip during the Maha Kumbh and wondered if they had been directed not to do so by ""Uncle Soros and Uncle Sam."" Thakur said even former PM Jawaharlal Nehru took a dip in the Sangam but today's generation of the Congress is avoiding it.

Winning over Jats: How BJP scored a perfect 10 in Delhi elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/winning-over-jats-how-bjp-scored-a-perfect-10/articleshow/118126209.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"A notable win was Parvesh Verma's, which consolidated Jat youth support. Dissatisfaction with AAP's handling of rural problems and a lack of Jat representation in the INDIA bloc also contributed to BJP's success.
 
NEW DELHI: The BJP swept all 10 Jat-dominated constituencies in Delhi into its kitty, capturing territory that they did not have in the last two elections.
Party officials attributed the strong Jat support for the BJP to several factors, particularly the party's focus on addressing rural problems and its willingness to give tickets to several Jat functionaries.
A senior BJP functionary said that there were several problems in Jat-dominated areas, such as registries, a crumbling civic infrastructure, and a need for better connectivity. ""Through DDA and with the support of the lieutenant governor, some work was done. The Jats realised that central govt assistance could play a key role in their development, which was not happening,"" the BJP source said.
Days before the elections, the representatives from all 360 villages of Delhi declared their backing for BJP. Their decision stemmed from a general dissatisfaction with Delhi govt for its failure to resolve issues affecting rural communities.
Another BJP functionary said that giving a ticket to Parvesh Verma also helped, as it led to the consolidation of the community, especially the youth, in BJP's favour. 
He said the bitter political confrontation, when AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal called Verma a traitor for giving money to women through his NGO before the model code of conduct kicked in, also did not help AAP. ""When Kejriwal made personal statements targeting Parvesh Verma through his press briefings, he often made it a Jat issue as well,"" the BJP functionary said.
Also, when Verma was pitched against Kejriwal, it made the contest a battle of personalities, which led to a strong Jat backing for BJP. The BJP also swept outer Delhi seats, which were once the stronghold of his father and former chief minister Sahib Singh Verma.
Another functionary said that having senior Jat functionaries contesting the polls helped in different ways. When AAP raised the issue of Jat reservation, these functionaries were quick to respond that if the party was serious then it should have first brought the proposal in the Vidhan Sabha when it was ruling, but it never did. ""The voices got amplified,"" he said.
Paramjeet Sejwal, who lives in Lado Sarai, said: ""There were several reasons for the BJP's gain. The crumbling infrastructure when not much was happening on the development front was one. Second, people in the community saw leaders such as Kailash Gahlot leaving. Also, the INDIA bloc did not give any ticket to people from the Jat community. So, these factors started consolidating after a point.""
In Lado Sarai, which is part of the Jat-influenced seat of Mehrauli, Gajendra Yadav of BJP won by 1,786 votes. The margins in other seats were larger. In the Jat-dominated seat of Najafgarh, Neelam Pahalwan of BJP won by 29,009 votes against Tarun Kumar of AAP. Last time, AAP got 72,699 votes in this seat.
Gahlot, a former AAP govt minister who switched sides before the polls, won by 11,276 votes against Surendra Bharadwaj of AAP.
In the Palam constituency, a key seat where Jats are in significant numbers, Kuldeep Solanki of BJP won by a margin of 8,952 votes against Joginder Solanki of AAP. The AAP polled 73,094 votes in this seat.
In Nangloi Jat, Manoj Kumar Shokeen of BJP won against Raghuvinder Shokeen of AAP by a margin of 26,251 votes. The party won Narela by 8,596 votes, Rithala by 29,616, Mundka by 10,550 and Nangloi Jat by 26,251. In Vikaspuri, Matiala and Palam also , BJP got good winning margins.

The report is expected to shed light on various issues including irregularities in excise policy, renovation of former CM's residence, and education policies.

The Delhi assembly's first session will begin on February 24, where MLAs will take their oath and elect a new Speaker.
""The report will be tabled in the House and many things will come to light. I think the truth will come out in the CAG report. Whether it is education, liquor, or Sheesh Mahal, many such issues will be raised in the House,"" said Khurana.
Khurana criticized AAP for not presenting the report earlier, emphasizing that the new BJP-led government would operate according to constitutional norms.
""The 8th assembly formed yesterday and its first session will begin tomorrow with the oath of the MLAs and the election of the Speaker and the next day the CAG report will be tabled. This report should have been tabled in the 7th Assembly, as per the rules. But now whatever work the Delhi government will do will be done as per the rules, as per the Constitution,"" Khurana stated.
AAP's national spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar responded by questioning BJP's commitment to their campaign promises, particularly regarding the Rs 2,500 financial assistance scheme for Delhi women.
""BJP should display optimistic politics. They should work on the promises they made to the people of Delhi instead of imposing their agenda. They said that in the first cabinet meeting, a resolution would be passed that every woman in Delhi would get Rs 2500 per month in her account,"" Kakkar said.
Kakkar pointed out that BJP had not addressed their promises in their first cabinet meeting, contrasting this with AAP's record of fulfilling their commitments when they came to power.

MSRTC workers' union said the security of bus drivers and conductors is now at stake.
On Saturday, the MSRTC cancelled 250 buses that operate between Maharashtra and Karnataka in the wake of the violence. Six of these buses operate from Pune. Abhijit Bhosle, the MSRTC public relations officer, said it is not certain whether the buses would operate on Sunday. ""We will take a call after consultation with police. At this moment, nothing can be said,"" the official told TOI. 
As the MSRTC buses towards Karnataka did not ply on Saturday, more than 20 buses from the Kolhapur Central bus stand were cancelled. Passengers were stranded at the bus stand.
Shiv Sena (UBT) workers protested against the incident at the Kolhapur Central bus stand on Saturday morning. They put up saffron flags on the Karnataka State Road Transport buses and raised slogans against the Karnataka govt. Shahupuri police detained the Shiv Sena (UBT) workers.
Vijay Dewane, the district convenor of Shiv Sena (UBT), said, ""The Maharashtra chief minister should immediately stop all the Karnataka buses from entering our state. Karnataka govt should apologise for this act, else a befitting reply will be given.""
The Maharashtra-Karnataka border dispute has been going on for several years now. Whenever the border dispute flares up, the first to bear the brunt often are the state transport buses. 
MSRTC bus conductor Prashant Thorat, who was in the bus that was attacked on Friday, said, ""Our driver, Bhaskar Jadhav, was driving the Bengaluru-Pune MSRTC bus from Chitradurga to Kolhapur when, around 9.30pm, activists of the Karnataka Navanirman Sene turned up in four to five vehicles and blocked the way. The activists, carrying red-yellow flags and scarves, the Jadhav if he could speak in Kannada. When the driver said no, he was pulled out of the bus. His face was blackened. The activists raised slogans screaming ‘If you can't speak Kannada, then you will not be allowed into Karnataka'. Black ink was also splashed on the bus. This continued for half an hour. Our bus was stranded there till 4 am and we, including all the passengers, were very scared as we didn't know the Kannada language either."" 
Repercussions of this incident are now likely to be felt in parts of Maharashtra as well. Uttam Patil, the divisional secretary of the MSRTC workers' union, said, ""There should be coordination between the two states regarding interstate traffic. The number of passengers travelling from Maharashtra to Karnataka is huge. If the corporation takes responsibility for the safety of drivers and conductors, we have no problem in going to Karnataka. MSRTC drivers and the general public are being dragged into the organisational and political tussle. The transport corporations of both states should sit together and decide on safety.""

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi will travel to Mauritius next month as chief guest for the national day celebrations of the Indian Ocean country. After 2015, this is the second time Modi has been given that honour by Mauritius.
The announcement about Modi's participation as the guest of honour on the 57th anniversary of the independence of Mauritius on March 12 was made by PM Navinchandra Ramgoolam in Parliament on Friday.
""It is indeed a singular privilege for our country to host such a distinguished personality, who is doing us this honour in spite of his very tight schedule and in spite of his recent visits to Paris and the United States. He has agreed to be here as our special guest. The visit of Modi is a testimony of the close relations between our two nations,"" said Ramgoolam.
President Droupadi Murmu attended 
Mauritius National Day celebrations
 last year as the chief guest. With 70% of its people tracing their roots to India, Mauritius is a key partner for India in the western Indian Ocean.
India last year strongly backed the agreement between the United Kingdom and Mauritius for the return of Mauritian sovereignty over the Chagos archipelago, including Diego Garcia, saying it completed the decolonisation of Mauritius. India has consistently supported Mauritius's claim for sovereignty over Chagos, in line with its long-held position on decolonization and support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations, as well as its longstanding and close partnership with Mauritius.

The conductor had an argument with the college student when she insisted that he speak to her in Marathi, after he demanded that her male companion buy a ticket for the ride. Later, around 20 people boarded the bus at Balekundri and beat up the driver and conductor. 
Kannada outfits that had already expressed their ire over the attack on the crew, raised the pitch several notches higher on Saturday.
Condemning the incident and registering of a case against the conductor under the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, activists of Karnataka Nava Nirmana Sene blackened the face of a 
Maharashtra bus conductor
 and the front windshield of a bus in Chitradurga on Saturday. Meanwhile, 
Karnataka Rakshana Vedike
 activists protested outside Marihal police station and at Channamma Circle.
Police have arrested four persons so far, including a minor, in connection with the assault. While three of them were remanded in judicial custody for 14 days, the minor was sent to a remand home on Friday night. 
The incident led to disruption in bus services between Karnataka and Maharashtra, with Kannada outfits in Karnataka and Shiv Sena activists on the Maharashtra side of the border protesting.
Police commissioner Iada Martin Marbaniang said: ""Three teams have been formed to search for the remaining accused. The victim was a minor girl, and a complaint was filed on her behalf under Section 12 of the Pocso Act against the conductor.""
Police said precautionary measures have been taken to maintain law and order, and SPs along the Karnataka-Maharashtra border will be told to share information about the steps to be taken to prevent any untoward incident.

Meitei organisation calls for extended timeframe to surrender illegal weapons in Manipur,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/meitei-organisation-calls-for-extended-timeframe-to-surrender-illegal-weapons-in-manipur/articleshow/118487878.cms,Manipur,General News,"IMPHAL: In response to Manipur Governor 
Ajay Kumar Bhalla
's appeal to the people of the strife-torn state to voluntarily surrender looted and illegally held weapons within seven days, an umbrella body of Imphal-based civil society organisations of the Meiteis on Saturday requested him to ""engage formally with local youth leaders to ensure a cooperative approach in recovering arms from civilian volunteers"". In a statement, the 
Coordinating Committee on Manipur Integrity
 (COCOMI) also said that the ""seven-day timeframe is too short for meaningful engagement with the stakeholders and the public."" 
Bhalla had on February 20 urged the people of the state to surrender weapons within seven days, assuring no punitive action would be initiated against those giving up arms during this period. He, however, had asserted that ""strict action"" would be taken after the expiry of the deadline. 
COCOMI said, ""We acknowledge this (governor's appeal for surrendering arms) as a necessary step under the law of the land. However, it is imperative to recognise the circumstances that led local youth to take up arms and loot weapons. This situation arose due to the incompetence of the government's security forces, which failed to protect vulnerable villages at the peak of the crisis. 
Asserting that the seven-day timeframe for surrendering arms is too short for meaningful engagement with stakeholders and the public, the committee said, ""An extension of time would allow for better public understanding and cooperation, helping to prevent any misunderstanding or resistance."" 
It also appealed to Bhalla that no legal action be taken against civilian volunteers who were compelled to defend their communities. 
""The process of arms confiscation should not be limited to the looted weapons alone; it must also extend to the unaccounted number of illegal arms smuggled across the border and used by armed groups operating under the so-called Suspension of Operation (SoO) agreement with the Centre,"" it said. 
""Transparency is crucial, reports on the confiscation of arms from the hills must be made public to ensure a rational and fair approach,"" it added. 
COCOMI also sought ""assurance from the governor and relevant authorities that all armed Kuki militant camps under SoO in the surrounding hill areas be shifted to other locations so that law and order is fully restored. The government must come up with a concrete, foolproof plan to secure villages, instill a sense of safety among villagers and their volunteers, and provide a firm guarantee that no further attacks will take place,"" it said.

Delhi man kills Goa woman after feud over dog walking,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-man-kills-goa-woman-after-feud-over-dog-walking/articleshow/118487568.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"This is a representational image (Pic credit: Canva)
 
PANAJI: A Delhi man was arrested Saturday for mowing down a resident of Goa's Mandrem locality with his four-wheeler following a feud over walking a dog the previous night.
Investigations revealed that the family of the victim, Maria Joao Fernandes, had fought with the kin of the accused, Deepak Rajeev Batra. While Batra was walking with his parents, he got into a verbal duel with Maria's son, who objected to walking the dog close to his mother's house. The argument soon escalated into a physical altercation, with both sides exchanging blows and sustaining injuries, police said.
An enraged Batra then sat in his car with his parents and ran over Maria with the speeding vehicle around 9pm Friday. She succumbed to severe injuries. Later that night, villagers gathered at Mandrem police station demanding Batra's arrest. They left the premises the next morning only after being promised action.
North Goa SP Akshat Kaushal said initially, police received a report about an accident in Junaswada area wherein a woman had been hit by a car. ""Police immediately began an investigation. The car involved in the accident was seized and Batra, a resident of New Multan Nagar in Delhi's Paschim Vihar area, was arrested,"" the SP said.
""The accused's hands bore bite marks, for which a medical examination was conducted. An FIR under BNSS Sections 103 (murder) and 281 (rash driving) was registered,"" SP Kaushal said, adding that a forensic examination of the crime scene and the vehicle was conducted.
Batra had previously worked as a chef in Dubai.

"Indira Gandhi remark: Blankets, mattress brought to Rajasthan assembly as Congress MLAs continue sit-in protest",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indira-gandhi-remark-blankets-mattress-brought-to-rajasthan-assembly-as-congress-mlas-continue-sit-in-protest/articleshow/118458075.cms,Rajasthan,General News,"NEW DELHI: Blankets and mattress were brought to Rajasthan assembly on Friday night for Congress MLAs to camp inside the House in protest.
A video showed a few people arranging quilts and mattresses for the protesting Congress MLAs. The party leaders have planned to continue their sit-in protest inside the assembly over the suspension of six of its members from the remaining period of the budget session.
Six Congress MLAs, including state party chief Govind Singh Dotasra, were suspended from remainder of Rajasthan assembly's budget session, news agency PTI reported.
The assembly witnessed a chaos on earlier after social justice and empowerment minister Avinash Gehlot’s remark during a discussion on hostels for working women triggered outrage among Congress MLAs. The uproar led to three adjournments and the suspension of Congress legislators.
While responding during the Question Hour, Gehlot said, “In the 2023-24 budget too, like always, you named the scheme after your ‘dadi’ (grandmother) Indira Gandhi.” The comment angered Congress MLAs, who stormed into the well of the House, raising slogans and demanding an apology.
Leader of opposition Tikaram Jully insisted that the “inappropriate word” be removed from official records, while PCC chief Govind Singh Dotasra demanded the remark be expunged and the minister issue an apology. Dotasra’s attempt to approach the Speaker led to marshals being called in, escalating tensions.
The House faced repeated adjournments — first for half an hour during Question Hour, then till 2 pm, and later till 4 pm — as Congress MLAs continued their protest. When proceedings resumed, government chief whip Jogeshwar Garg condemned the opposition’s conduct, calling it “unforgivable” and moved for the suspension of six Congress MLAs — Govind Singh Dotasra, Ramkesh Meena, Amin Kagzi, Jakir Hussain, Hakim Ali, and Sanjay Kumar — for the rest of the session. The motion was passed by voice vote.
Congress MLAs staged a sit-in protest inside the House after the adjournment.

Stalin vs Dharmendra Pradhan escalates: 'Is imposing Hindi in name of NEP not politics?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/stalin-vs-dharmendra-pradhan-escalates-is-imposing-hindi-in-name-of-nep-not-politics/articleshow/118457124.cms,Madhya Pradesh,Dhar,"Pradhan, Stalin in war of words over NEP
 
NEW DELHI: As Union education minister 
Dharmendra Pradhan
 asked 
Tamil Nadu
 chief minister 
MK Stalin
 to 'rise above politics' amid ""
imposition of Hindi
"" through National Education Policy row, the chief minister on Friday hit back at the minister accusing him of doing politics in education.
In a sharp rebuttal to Pradhan's letter, Stalin accused the Centre of politicizing education while denying crucial funds to the state. 
“Who is really doing politics in education—you or us?” Stalin questioned. “Isn’t it political blackmail to condition fund release on accepting the trilingual policy? Isn’t imposing Hindi in the name of NEP politics? Turning a multilingual, diverse country into a single-language nation—if that’s not politics, then what is? Converting funds meant for one scheme into leverage for implementing another is pure politics,” he declared.
Stalin further alleged that while the DMK government focuses on welfare initiatives, the BJP-led central government spends its resources on fanning communal tensions and pushing Hindi across states. His comments came during the launch of 602 completed projects worth Rs 704.89 crore, the foundation laying for 178 new projects valued at Rs 384.41 crore, and the distribution of welfare aids worth Rs 387 crore to nearly 45,000 beneficiaries.
Reacting to Pradhan’s claim that Tamil Nadu is missing out on Rs 5,000 crore for not adopting the PM SHRI School initiative, Stalin retorted, “It wouldn’t take us a second to say we won’t send you Tamil Nadu’s tax collections either.” He emphasized that cooperative federalism is about mutual ‘giving and receiving,’ calling it a constitutional principle the Centre seems to have forgotten.
Stalin accused the BJP of using the NEP not to uplift education but to covertly promote Hindi. “The Centre knows it can’t directly impose Hindi without facing fierce opposition, so it uses education as a backdoor,” he said. “We know how to nurture our mother tongue. Ask those who’ve lost theirs after embracing Hindi. We don’t need your help to protect Tamil,” he asserted.
Issuing a stern warning to the Centre, Stalin said, “Don’t throw stones at a beehive. Don’t provoke the fighting spirit of the Tamils. As long as I and the DMK exist, no force working against Tamil Nadu, its language, or its people will be allowed entry.”
Reaffirming the Dravidian model of governance, Stalin highlighted its commitment to people’s welfare and the removal of systemic obstacles. “Challenges aren’t new to us. We know how to overcome them. With the people’s support, we’ll continue on the path of progress and victory,” he concluded. 
Earlier in the day, Pradhan on Friday wrote to the Tamil Nadu CM, clarifying that the 
NEP 2020
 does not mandate any language. He targeted the Tamil Nadu CM for interpreting NEP 2020 with a ""myopic vision"" and for portraying progressive educational reforms as political threats. 
Pradhan also stated that the chief minister's letter to PM contradicted the spirit of cooperative federalism. Pradhan urged the Tamil Nadu government to ""rise above political differences for the interest of young learners."" 
He also added, ""By not implementing NEP 2020, we are depriving our students, teachers, and parents of global and pan-India opportunities. Rejecting a student-centric, future-focused policy is really regressive. Education should not be politicised. Misrepresented facts won’t solve anything. Even many non-BJP states are implementing NEP, taking full cooperation from the federal government. Tamil Nadu is losing out on Rs 5,000 crore by not implementing PM Shri Schools, which focus on scientific education and teaching methods in the Tamil language.""

Money laundering case: President Murmu grants sanction to ED to prosecute AAP leader Satyendar Jain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/money-laundering-case-president-murmu-grants-sanction-to-ed-to-prosecute-aap-leader-satyendar-jain/articleshow/118359844.cms,Nagaland,Mon,"NEW DELHI: 
President Droupadi Murmu
 on Tuesday granted sanction to the 
Enforcement Directorate
 (ED) to prosecute 
AAP leader
 and former Delhi minister 
Satyendar Jain
 in a 
money laundering case
, reported news agency PTI citing sources.
Earlier last year in October, a city court granted bail to the former Delhi minister citing delays in the trial and his prolonged incarceration of 18 months.
Special Judge Vishal Gogne said, ""Considering the delay in trial and long incarceration of 18 months, and the fact that the trial will take long to start, let alone conclude, the accused is favourably suited for the relief,"" said the court special judge Vishal Gogne.
The investigative agency arrested Jain in May 2022 in connection with the money-laundering case involving alleged hawala transactions. At the time of his ED detention, Jain was responsible for health, power and several other portfolios in the Delhi governement.
The Ministry of Home Affairs, citing an ED investigation and sufficient evidence, sought presidential sanction to prosecute 60-year-old former 
Delhi health minister
 under Section 218 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, sources told PTI.
The prosecution of public servants and judges falls under Section 218 of the BNSS, which details the process for initiating legal proceedings against officials for alleged misconduct during their tenure.
Sources indicate that the ED plans to submit a new supplementary charge sheet to inform the court about the President's approval for prosecution sanction.
According to a TOI report, ED had already questioned Jain, his close associates and family members on the details of a money trail seeking to establish the source of around Rs 27.7 crore used by five shell companies — Prayas Infosolutions Pvt Ltd, Indo Metal Impex Pvt Ltd, JJ Ideal Estate Pvt Ltd, Akinchan Developers Pvt Ltd and Mangalyatan Projects Pvt Ltd — to purchase the 123 acres from 14 people.
Jain's chartered accountant JP Mohta and three Kolkata based hawala operators — Jivendra Mishra, Abhishek Chokhani and Rajendra Bansal — in their recorded statements claimed that ""all the (five) shell companies incorporated by Jain were actually being controlled by him through his wife, relatives and other close associates. All of them corroborated the fact that cash was paid to the hawala dealers and ‘entries' (unsecured loans) were received in shell companies"".
ED had claimed that these five shell companies spent Rs 27.69 crore to acquire the land parcels. Jain was a minister in the AAP govt in Delhi from December 28, 2013 to February 14, 2014 and again from February 2015 till much after his arrest in 2022.

Jammu and Kashmir
 chief minister 
Omar Abdullah
 on Tuesday said that the implementation of the three 
new criminal laws
 in the Union Territory has been largely successful, barring a few minor issues that will be addressed. 
His remarks came after attending a review meeting chaired by Union home minister 
Amit Shah
 at the ministry of home affairs (MHA) in New Delhi.
""By and large, the implementation of the new laws in Jammu and Kashmir has been successful, with only a few issues that will be rectified,"" Abdullah told reporters after the meeting.
The meeting was attended by J&K lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha, senior government officials and key representatives from the home ministry. 
It focused on assessing the rollout of the 
Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita
 (BNS), the 
Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita
 (BNSS) and the 
Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam
 (BSA), which replaced the colonial-era Indian Penal Code, Code of Criminal Procedure, and Indian Evidence Act, respectively.
Need for 
public awareness
While Abdullah acknowledged that the implementation of criminal laws falls under the jurisdiction of the Central government, he stressed the importance of making people aware of the new legal provisions.
""Though it is not the elected government's responsibility to implement these laws in a Union Territory, it is essential to educate the public about their provisions and implications. Awareness must be raised in colleges, universities, and public forums,"" he said.
The CM also stated that no law and order issues were discussed during the meeting, clarifying that such discussions took place during a separate meeting with Amit Shah at Parliament recently.
Abdullah was also questioned about his absence from recent security review meetings on Jammu and Kashmir. Responding to this, he said, ""If a decision is taken that the elected government will not be called for security review meetings, what can we do? That is fine.""
His remarks highlight the ongoing debate over the role of the elected J&K government in security-related decision-making, particularly since the abrogation of 
Article 370
 in 2019, which led to the bifurcation of the erstwhile state into two Union Territories, Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.
During the meeting, Shah said that a similar review had already been conducted for 11 states and Union Territories. The implementation of the new laws in J&K was assessed across police, courts, prosecution, forensic systems, and prison administration.
In recent months, the home minister has held similar meetings with several states, including Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana and Maharashtra. The government has emphasised that these new laws are aimed at ensuring faster justice delivery, with the goal of resolving criminal cases within three years from FIR registration to the final judgment.
Abdullah also addressed the recent disagreement between Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and PM Modi over the appointment of the 
Chief Election Commissioner
 (CEC). He defended Gandhi’s right to dissent, stating, ""He has a right to dissent... that is why he is there. He is not there just to agree with the government’s decision.""

Gujarat gynaec hospital videos shared on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarat-gynaec-hospital-videos-shared-on-social-media/articleshow/118341292.cms,Gujarat,General News,"RAJKOT/AHMEDABAD: In a serious breach of 
women's privacy
, CCTV videos from a private hospital in Rajkot showing women undergoing gynecological check-ups and medical treatment were circulated on social media, prompting the police to lodge an offence.
The Ahmedabad cybercrime branch, which was entrusted the probe along with its Rajkot counterparts, revealed that videos of multiple women were uploaded to YouTube and shared on Telegram channels. The footage was traced back to a CCTV camera installed in the hospital's outdoor patient department (OPD).
The YouTube channel, identified as 'Megha MBBS,' not only hosted the videos but also included Telegram links in the comments section, allowing viewers to access additional content. Several subscription offers to view other such explicit content were also made in the links. Over the past month, these videos have reportedly garnered more than five lakh views.
The hospital, located in a commercial complex near Raiya Crossroads in Rajkot, came under scrutiny after the breach came to light on Monday. 
Rajkot's deputy commissioner of crime (DCP) Dr. Parthrajsinh Gohil confirmed that a team had visited the hospital to gather more details. Cybercrime team found that the videos were first shared on Telegram in Sept 2024 and later uploaded to YouTube on Jan 6, 2025. One particularly disturbing clip showed a woman being administered an injection.
Assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Ahmedabad cybercrime, Hardik Makadia, said, ""The circulation of such videos is a grave violation of privacy. A case has been registered under sections 66E and 67 of the Information Technology Act, addressing privacy violations and the publication of obscene material online,"" he said.
Police are working to identify and apprehend those responsible for the breach. Efforts are also being made to remove the footage from all platforms to protect the victims' privacy.
State health minister and government spokesman Rushikesh Patel said that he had been informed about the video leaks through media reports. He confirmed that the Ahmedabad Cybercrime Branch had already registered a case and that necessary action would follow once the investigation concludes.
""There are technical aspects to consider, including whether the hospital's CCTV system was hacked. The hospital's version of events will also be recorded. The government will decide on further action after a thorough investigation,"" Patel said.
The minister added that government hospitals do not install CCTVs in patient treatment areas to ensure privacy and that private hospitals have been instructed to adhere to similar guidelines in the past.

"Replace Urdu with Sanskrit, another school in Rajasthan told",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/replace-urdu-with-sanskrit-another-school-in-rajasthan-told/articleshow/118339855.cms,Rajasthan,General News,"JAIPUR: A govt senior secondary school in Bikaner has become the second institute in Rajasthan to receive a communication from the education department to replace Urdu with Sanskrit as a third language from the new academic session commencing in April. Director of secondary education Ashish Modi's Feb 14 order came within days of the school education department directing Mahatma Gandhi Govt School at Jaipur's RAC Battalion to and introduce Sanskrit and stop Urdu classes, citing ""low enrolment"". He was unavailable for comment.
Amid growing resentment against the twin orders, a fresh controversy broke Monday over minister of state for home 
Jawahar Singh Bedham
 purportedly saying in a viral video that many Urdu teachers in the state secured jobs with fake degrees. ""The previous (Congress) govt removed Sanskrit teachers and deployed Urdu teachers in their place. We don't know Urdu, and no one even studies that subject, which is why we will discontinue the posts of Urdu teachers and provide the kind of education that people want here,"" Bedham alleges in the video from a recent event held in Bharatpur.
Urdu teachers took exception to what they said were ""baseless and irresponsible"" remarks by the minister.
""Terming degrees of Urdu teachers 'fake' without an investigation is wrong. Also, the allegation against the previous govt of appointing Urdu teachers against Sanskrit posts is false. The minister is trying to mobilise the majority community by targeting the linguistic minority. This is politics of hatred,"" Amin Kayamkhani, president of the Rajasthan Urdu Teachers' Association, said.
In Bikaner, the move to replace Urdu with Sanskrit at Napasar Sinthal Road Govt Senior Secondary School is based on the area's needs, officials said. ""A lone Class 12 student studies Urdu. In Class 11, there's nobody with Urdu as third language. This is reason why it is being discontinued,"" a teacher said.

"After drubbing AAP in Delhi, 'Bangal cholo' next for BJP?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-drubbing-aap-in-delhi-bangla-chalo-next-for-bjp/articleshow/118116026.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"PTI photo (File)
 
NEW DELHI: Since 2014, the BJP has been moving from one poll victory to another -- both on the national as well as the state level -- with seemingly nothing able to stand in the way of the Modi wave. 
However, one thorn in BJP's side was Delhi, where the Arvind Kejriwal-led fortress managed to survive the saffron tsunami not once, but twice.
However, 2025 proved to be a breakthrough year as the BJP broke the 27-year-old jinx to storm back to power in the Capital. It defeated the indomitable Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) by winning 48 seats in the 70-member Delhi assembly.
Bristling with confidence after acquiring the Rajdhani in the North, the party has already given clear indications that its next mission is to make inroads in the eastern state of West Bengal.
Like Delhi, making inroads in the Mamata Banerjee-ruled Bengal has been an uphill task for the BJP for the past two assembly elections.
In the 2016 assembly elections, buoyed by the majority mandate at the Centre, the BJP expected to emerge as a key party but faced an embarrassing defeat. The party won only 3 seats in the 294-seat West Bengal assembly.
In 2019, the BJP came back to power at the Centre with an even bigger mandate and by then had a decent presence in even the northeastern states, where BJP had negligible presence before 2014.
Two years down the line, the party made another attempt to breach the fortress of Mamata Banerjee but to no avail. 
In 2021, when the results trickled in, the BJP won only 77 seats with TMC winning a whopping mandate by securing victory on 215 seats. Though the BJP vote and seat share improved substantially, it was far less than the 200-seat mark the party had expected to win in the polls.
Just like Delhi in 2015 and 2020, the BJP fell flat in Bengal in 2016 and 2021.
However, with the BJP finally triumphing in Delhi, Bengal BJP leaders now see the possibility that Bengal may not be ""mission impossible"" anymore.
As BJP was celebrating its victory in the Capital on February 8, its top Bengal leader Suvendu Adhikari shot off a salvo at CM Mamata Banerjee, saying after the national capital, Bengal would vote for the BJP by uprooting ruling TMC.
""Delhi ki jeet hamari hai ... 2026 mein Bengal ki baari hai … (Delhi's victory is ours ... in 2026 it will be Bengal's turn),"" Adhikari said while reacting to BJP's massive comeback after 27 years of political exile.
Pumped by the BJP's historic win in Delhi, Bengal BJP chief and Union minister Sukanta Majumdar said Delhi's victory would serve as a morale booster for party workers in West Bengal ahead of next year's assembly elections.
BJP's Amit Malviya, who heads the party's I-T department, said that ""jitters from the Delhi results are being felt in West Bengal"" and claimed that ""nervous"" Mamata Banerjee would go solo in next year's assembly polls.
""A nervous Mamata Banerjee has told TMC MLAs that there will be NO alliance in Bengal … It is not surprising that she applies a different yardstick to the opposition in Haryana and Delhi but is unwilling to cede space for the alliance at home,"" Malviya wrote on X.

"No discontent in Punjab AAP, asserts Bhagwant Mann; all MLAs attend Delhi meet",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-discontent-in-punjab-aap-asserts-bhagwant-mann-all-mlas-attend-delhi-meet/articleshow/118157908.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"NEW DELHI: Punjab CM 
Bhagwant Mann
 on Tuesday dismissed claims by Congress and BJP of unrest brewing among AAP MLAs, tamping down speculation that the ripples from AAP's Delhi debacle may pose a risk to his govt.
Talking to reporters after the surprise move of party boss Arvind Kejriwal to summon Punjab CM, ministers, MPs and MLAs to Delhi, Mann took on Congress and said ""switching sides is Congress's culture"" and reminded Partap Singh Bajwa, the leader of opposition in Punjab, that his party drew a blank in Delhi.
Ahead of the meeting, which AAP said was attended by all 92 Punjab MLAs, Bajwa had alleged that the party was preparing the ground to oust Mann from the CM's post. He had also claimed that over 30 AAP MLAs were in touch with his party. 
Meeting sparks speculation about instability in 
Punjab AAP
 Instead of counting our MLAs, he should see how many Congress candidates won in Delhi,"" Bhagwant Mann said. Kejriwal and other senior functionaries held a meeting with Punjab functionaries to ostensibly thank them for their involvement in Delhi campaign.
According to AAP, the meeting at Kapurthala House saw all MLAs from Punjab and MPs from the state come together in what the party projected as a show of solidarity and normalcy amid the gloom of the Delhi loss. Besides Kejriwal and former deputy CM Manish Sisodia, national organisational secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Sandeep Pathak and RS MP Raghav Chadha were present.
Kejriwal is learnt to have asked the Punjab MLAs to reconnect with voters while working unitedly to pave the way for AAP's return to office in 2027. The timing of the meeting following AAP's defeat in Delhi had sparked speculation about instability in the party's Punjab unit. Asked about Bajwa's allegation that he could quit AAP with a group of MLAs, Mann said, ""Let them say so. We cultivated the party with hard work by going to every nook and corner of the state. They don't worry about their own party and find fault with others. It is Congress that has a culture of switching parties.""
BJP's newly-elected Rajouri Garden MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa claimed Mann's ""nervousness and body language"" after the meeting ""supports the conspiracy theory"" that he had spoken of on Monday. Sirsa had alleged that Kejriwal was scripting a narrative to oust Mann. 
AAP's estranged RS MP Swati Maliwal also took a dig at Kejriwal and said, ""Some people have started treating Punjab as their personal ATM. Today, massive corruption is rampant in Punjab.""

NEW DELHI: Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann on Tuesday responded to Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa's claim that 30 Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs were in contact with him. 
""Pratap Singh Bajwa has been saying this for almost three years. Let him say whatever he wants. I would ask Pratap Singh Bajwa to count how many MLAs they (Congress) have in Delhi,"" Mann told reporters. 
Mann also said, ""He (Bajwa) has been making claims earlier also that 20 MLAs or 40 MLAs are in touch with him. Let them say it. We have formed this party with our sweat and blood, going among people in villages and towns in the state.""
Poll
Do you agree with the claim made by Congress?
No, it's just political talk
Yes, it seems likely
After AAP's loss in the Delhi assembly elections, Bajwa claimed that an internal struggle would start between Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann and AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal. He also said that over 30 AAP MLAs were in contact with the Congress and were ready to switch sides. 
Congress MP Pramod Tiwari, however, denied that AAP MLAs were in touch with either the BJP or Congress. He said Congress does not support breaking other parties but is observing the political situation in Punjab. 
""BJP has a history of horse-trading and breaking parties—we have seen this in Maharashtra, Goa, Manipur also. They will try to do this in Punjab as well. As far as Congress is concerned, we do not believe in breaking parties. Our party's state leadership is monitoring the situation over there,"" Tiwari said while talking to news agency ANI. 
Earlier in the day, Mann arrived at Kapurthala House in New Delhi for a meeting with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal amid reports of differences within AAP. 
""Our MLAs reached here, and we had a meeting with party national convenor Arvind Kejriwal. He thanked them all for campaigning during the Delhi Assembly elections. Our government in Punjab has always worked for public welfare, whether in education or infrastructure. We need to speed up… Winning and losing is a part of the game. People of Delhi still remember us as someone who worked for them. We have two years more in Punjab. We will make Punjab a good model,"" Mann told the media. 
AAP, which had ruled Delhi for ten years, won only 22 out of 70 seats in the February 5 elections, while the BJP secured a majority, ending AAP's rule in the capital. 
There is also speculation that Kejriwal may take a bigger role in Punjab politics, with discussions about him contesting the vacant Ludhiana Assembly seat. However, AAP MP Malvinder Singh Kang dismissed these reports, calling the meeting a ""routine strategy session."" 
Meanwhile, BJP leader Rohini Vijender Gupta criticized AAP, saying the party is struggling after its defeat in the Delhi elections. 
""Kejriwal is doing a meeting, but it is a sinking ship. They are trying to keep their people together...but it will not last long,"" Gupta said.

This is how BJP celebrated Delhi poll victory in Parliament,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/bjp-celebrates-delhi-poll-victory-with-modi-modi-chants-in-parliament/articleshow/118126100.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"NEW DELHI: BJP's victory in the Delhi polls was hailed by NDA members with chanting of ""Modi, Modi"" slogan in both houses of Parliament on Monday, while former Union minister Anurag Thakur took a jibe at Rahul Gandhi in Lok Sabha over Congress's dismal performance in elections in the capital over the years.
BJP members in Rajya Sabha also ridiculed AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal for having once said that PM Modi would have to be reborn to unseat AAP in Delhi. They also stated that ""people had shown the mirror to those living in Sheesh Mahal"".
Soon after Lok Sabha proceedings started, BJP MPs raised the slogan, to which Congress MPs objected. The sloganeering went on for a while before Speaker Om Birla called for the question hour.
Taking a jibe Rahul in Lok Sabha, Thakur said, ""Rahul Ji, zero check kar lijiye... (Rahul, please check the zero) as Congress has consecutively secured zero seats third time in a row. Referring to Congress' poor track record, he said, ""How many seats did people of Delhi give to Congress in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections? Zero. In 2015? Zero. In 2019? Zero. In 2020? Zero. In 2024? Zero. And in 2025? Zero.""
When proceedings of the upper house began, BJP members started sloganeering in support of PM Modi. However, sloganeering was paused for a while when Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar extended birthday greetings to BJP's Sanjay Seth. It again started, with BJP MPs chanting ""Delhi ke dil me Modi hai, Desh ke dil me Modi hai"".
Meanwhile, BJP MP from Maharashtra Medha Vishram Kulkarni, while praising the budget, referred to its impact in Delhi polls, saying, ""People showed a mirror to those living in Sheesh Mahal.""
Quoting a Hindi couplet, BJP MP Dinesh Sharma, without naming Kejriwal, said his haughtiness got a befitting answer in AAP's stinging defeat. ""The defeat came in this very birth,"" he quipped.
Meanwhile in Lok Sabha, Thakur questioned Congress leaders for not taking a holy dip during the Maha Kumbh and wondered if they had been directed not to do so by ""Uncle Soros and Uncle Sam."" Thakur said even former PM Jawaharlal Nehru took a dip in the Sangam but today's generation of the Congress is avoiding it.

Winning over Jats: How BJP scored a perfect 10 in Delhi elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/winning-over-jats-how-bjp-scored-a-perfect-10/articleshow/118126209.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"A notable win was Parvesh Verma's, which consolidated Jat youth support. Dissatisfaction with AAP's handling of rural problems and a lack of Jat representation in the INDIA bloc also contributed to BJP's success.
 
NEW DELHI: The BJP swept all 10 Jat-dominated constituencies in Delhi into its kitty, capturing territory that they did not have in the last two elections.
Party officials attributed the strong Jat support for the BJP to several factors, particularly the party's focus on addressing rural problems and its willingness to give tickets to several Jat functionaries.
A senior BJP functionary said that there were several problems in Jat-dominated areas, such as registries, a crumbling civic infrastructure, and a need for better connectivity. ""Through DDA and with the support of the lieutenant governor, some work was done. The Jats realised that central govt assistance could play a key role in their development, which was not happening,"" the BJP source said.
Days before the elections, the representatives from all 360 villages of Delhi declared their backing for BJP. Their decision stemmed from a general dissatisfaction with Delhi govt for its failure to resolve issues affecting rural communities.
Another BJP functionary said that giving a ticket to Parvesh Verma also helped, as it led to the consolidation of the community, especially the youth, in BJP's favour. 
He said the bitter political confrontation, when AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal called Verma a traitor for giving money to women through his NGO before the model code of conduct kicked in, also did not help AAP. ""When Kejriwal made personal statements targeting Parvesh Verma through his press briefings, he often made it a Jat issue as well,"" the BJP functionary said.
Also, when Verma was pitched against Kejriwal, it made the contest a battle of personalities, which led to a strong Jat backing for BJP. The BJP also swept outer Delhi seats, which were once the stronghold of his father and former chief minister Sahib Singh Verma.
Another functionary said that having senior Jat functionaries contesting the polls helped in different ways. When AAP raised the issue of Jat reservation, these functionaries were quick to respond that if the party was serious then it should have first brought the proposal in the Vidhan Sabha when it was ruling, but it never did. ""The voices got amplified,"" he said.
Paramjeet Sejwal, who lives in Lado Sarai, said: ""There were several reasons for the BJP's gain. The crumbling infrastructure when not much was happening on the development front was one. Second, people in the community saw leaders such as Kailash Gahlot leaving. Also, the INDIA bloc did not give any ticket to people from the Jat community. So, these factors started consolidating after a point.""
In Lado Sarai, which is part of the Jat-influenced seat of Mehrauli, Gajendra Yadav of BJP won by 1,786 votes. The margins in other seats were larger. In the Jat-dominated seat of Najafgarh, Neelam Pahalwan of BJP won by 29,009 votes against Tarun Kumar of AAP. Last time, AAP got 72,699 votes in this seat.
Gahlot, a former AAP govt minister who switched sides before the polls, won by 11,276 votes against Surendra Bharadwaj of AAP.
In the Palam constituency, a key seat where Jats are in significant numbers, Kuldeep Solanki of BJP won by a margin of 8,952 votes against Joginder Solanki of AAP. The AAP polled 73,094 votes in this seat.
In Nangloi Jat, Manoj Kumar Shokeen of BJP won against Raghuvinder Shokeen of AAP by a margin of 26,251 votes. The party won Narela by 8,596 votes, Rithala by 29,616, Mundka by 10,550 and Nangloi Jat by 26,251. In Vikaspuri, Matiala and Palam also , BJP got good winning margins.

The report is expected to shed light on various issues including irregularities in excise policy, renovation of former CM's residence, and education policies.

The Delhi assembly's first session will begin on February 24, where MLAs will take their oath and elect a new Speaker.
""The report will be tabled in the House and many things will come to light. I think the truth will come out in the CAG report. Whether it is education, liquor, or Sheesh Mahal, many such issues will be raised in the House,"" said Khurana.
Khurana criticized AAP for not presenting the report earlier, emphasizing that the new BJP-led government would operate according to constitutional norms.
""The 8th assembly formed yesterday and its first session will begin tomorrow with the oath of the MLAs and the election of the Speaker and the next day the CAG report will be tabled. This report should have been tabled in the 7th Assembly, as per the rules. But now whatever work the Delhi government will do will be done as per the rules, as per the Constitution,"" Khurana stated.
AAP's national spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar responded by questioning BJP's commitment to their campaign promises, particularly regarding the Rs 2,500 financial assistance scheme for Delhi women.
""BJP should display optimistic politics. They should work on the promises they made to the people of Delhi instead of imposing their agenda. They said that in the first cabinet meeting, a resolution would be passed that every woman in Delhi would get Rs 2500 per month in her account,"" Kakkar said.
Kakkar pointed out that BJP had not addressed their promises in their first cabinet meeting, contrasting this with AAP's record of fulfilling their commitments when they came to power.

MSRTC workers' union said the security of bus drivers and conductors is now at stake.
On Saturday, the MSRTC cancelled 250 buses that operate between Maharashtra and Karnataka in the wake of the violence. Six of these buses operate from Pune. Abhijit Bhosle, the MSRTC public relations officer, said it is not certain whether the buses would operate on Sunday. ""We will take a call after consultation with police. At this moment, nothing can be said,"" the official told TOI. 
As the MSRTC buses towards Karnataka did not ply on Saturday, more than 20 buses from the Kolhapur Central bus stand were cancelled. Passengers were stranded at the bus stand.
Shiv Sena (UBT) workers protested against the incident at the Kolhapur Central bus stand on Saturday morning. They put up saffron flags on the Karnataka State Road Transport buses and raised slogans against the Karnataka govt. Shahupuri police detained the Shiv Sena (UBT) workers.
Vijay Dewane, the district convenor of Shiv Sena (UBT), said, ""The Maharashtra chief minister should immediately stop all the Karnataka buses from entering our state. Karnataka govt should apologise for this act, else a befitting reply will be given.""
The Maharashtra-Karnataka border dispute has been going on for several years now. Whenever the border dispute flares up, the first to bear the brunt often are the state transport buses. 
MSRTC bus conductor Prashant Thorat, who was in the bus that was attacked on Friday, said, ""Our driver, Bhaskar Jadhav, was driving the Bengaluru-Pune MSRTC bus from Chitradurga to Kolhapur when, around 9.30pm, activists of the Karnataka Navanirman Sene turned up in four to five vehicles and blocked the way. The activists, carrying red-yellow flags and scarves, the Jadhav if he could speak in Kannada. When the driver said no, he was pulled out of the bus. His face was blackened. The activists raised slogans screaming ‘If you can't speak Kannada, then you will not be allowed into Karnataka'. Black ink was also splashed on the bus. This continued for half an hour. Our bus was stranded there till 4 am and we, including all the passengers, were very scared as we didn't know the Kannada language either."" 
Repercussions of this incident are now likely to be felt in parts of Maharashtra as well. Uttam Patil, the divisional secretary of the MSRTC workers' union, said, ""There should be coordination between the two states regarding interstate traffic. The number of passengers travelling from Maharashtra to Karnataka is huge. If the corporation takes responsibility for the safety of drivers and conductors, we have no problem in going to Karnataka. MSRTC drivers and the general public are being dragged into the organisational and political tussle. The transport corporations of both states should sit together and decide on safety.""

 suspended state transport buses to Karnataka after 
pro-Kannada activists
 attacked an MSRTC bus in Chitradurga on Friday.
The activists targeted a bus travelling from Bengaluru to Mumbai, where they assaulted driver Bhaskar Jadhav. A police complaint has been lodged in Karnataka regarding this incident.
The minister detailed that the MSRTC bus (MH-14 KQ 7714) was attacked shortly after passing through Chitradurga. He said that bus services would remain suspended until the Karnataka government clarifies its position on the matter.
Meanwhile, a Karnataka state transport conductor was assaulted the same day near Belagavi for not speaking to a passenger in Marathi. 
Authorities have arrested four individuals for the assault while the conductor also faces charges under the POCSO Act for allegedly making derogatory remarks.
The 51-year-old conductor, Mahadevappa Mallappa Hukkeri, recalled that a female passenger and her companion at Sulebhavi village spoke to him in Marathi. When he expressed his inability to understand Marathi and requested them to speak in Kannada, the situation escalated.
Hukkeri explained that the girl demanded he learn Marathi and subsequently, a crowd gathered and attacked him. He received treatment at Belagavi Institute of Medical Sciences for minor injuries and is now stable.
On Saturday, pro-Kannada activists protested by blocking the Belagavi-Bagalkote road and burning effigies before being removed by police.
Additional protests occurred at Marihal police station, where activists condemned the alleged attack on the conductor and disputed the case against him. Police subsequently removed these protesters.

Kailash Mansarovar Yatra
. 
Jaishanker took to his social media platform X to post about the meeting., ""The G20 Foreign Ministers Meeting in Johannesburg provided an opportunity to meet CPC Politburo member and FM Wang Yi of China this morning on its sidelines.""
Separately addressing a weekly media briefing in New Delhi, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said ""The two ministers reviewed developments in the bilateral relationship since their last meeting in November, specifically the management of peace and tranquility in border areas."" 
The management of peace and tranquility in border areas, the Kailash Mansarovar yatra, resumption of direct flight connectivity, and travel facilitation were discussed during the meeting. 
There was also an exchange of views on G20 and the Shangai Cooperation Organization, the MEA spokesperson said.
Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri had visited Beijing on January 26-27 this year for a meeting of the Foreign Secretary-Vice Foreign Minister mechanism between India and China on January 27. 
A statement by MEA said that ""As agreed between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping at their meeting in Kazan in October, the two sides reviewed the state of India-China bilateral relations comprehensively and agreed to take certain people-centric steps to stabilize and rebuild ties"".
The two sides decided to resume the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra in the summer of 2025; the relevant mechanism will discuss the modalities for doing so as per existing agreements. 
India organizes the KMY annually between June and September through the Lipulekh Pass (since 1981) in Uttarakhand and the Nathu La Pass (since 2015) in Sikkim. 
Before the flights were suspended due to the pandemic and the Galwan clash in 2020, the two countries had 539 direct flights per month, with a total seat capacity of over 1.25 lakh.
Another significant announcement after the meeting of Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri in Beijing in January this year was that the resumption of direct air services will take place between the two countries, with relevant technical authorities on the two sides meeting and negotiating an updated framework for this purpose at an early date, the MEA said.
As 2025 marks the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between India and China, the two sides noted that it should be utilized to redouble public diplomacy efforts to create better awareness about each other and restore mutual trust and confidence among the public. The two sides have also said they will conduct a number of commemorative activities to mark this anniversary.
Today's meeting between Jaishankar and Wang comes after the two met on G20 November 18, 2024 in Rio de Janeiro on the sidelines of the G20 Summit.

'Dispatched two officers': Nepal's PM Oli after third year B Tech girl's death at KIIT university in Odisha,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dispatched-two-officers-nepals-pm-oli-after-third-year-b-tech-girls-death-at-kiit-university-in-odisha/articleshow/118332188.cms,Odisha,General News,"NEW DELHI: Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Monday responded to the death of a Nepali student at 
KIIT University
 in Odisha, saying that his government has dispatched two officers from the Nepalese Embassy in New Delhi to counsel affected students. 
“Our Embassy in New Delhi has dispatched two officers to counsel Nepali students affected in Odisha. Additionally, arrangements have been made to ensure they have the option to either remain in their hostel or return home, based on their preference,” he said.
The Embassy of India in Kathmandu also issued a statement expressing deep sorrow over the student's death. Offering condolences to the family, the Embassy confirmed it has been in contact with both KIIT authorities and the Odisha State Government. Local authorities have already initiated an investigation into the incident, which is being treated as a case of suspected suicide. 
The incident involved the alleged suicide of 
Prakriti Lamsal
, a third-year B-Tech student from Nepal, inside her hostel room at Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT). Following the discovery of her body on Sunday, tensions escalated on campus, with Nepali students staging protests demanding justice.
Her cousin filed a complaint at the Infocity police station, alleging that she took her own life due to blackmail by another student. Bhubaneswar DCP Pinak Mishra confirmed that a case has been registered on charges of abetment to suicide, and the accused student is in police custody. “We have seized the mobile phone, laptop, and other gadgets of the deceased woman. A scientific investigation is underway,” he stated, urging students to maintain peace.
Appeal all Nepali students to return and resume classes: University
In response to the growing unrest, KIIT authorities issued a notice ordering all Nepali students to vacate the campus immediately. “The institute was closed sine die for all international students from Nepal, and they are directed to vacate the university campus immediately today on 17th February,” the notice read.
Students were seen leaving hostels in large numbers, with reports emerging that they were given little time to prepare. Some claimed they had no clear travel arrangements or food. “We were protesting for the girl, and suddenly we were asked to vacate. We don’t know what their intentions are, but we were forcibly made to leave. I don’t have a train ticket or money,” Rajan Gupta, a Nepali student, told reporters.
KIIT Registrar Prof. Jnyana Ranjan Mohanty stated that the decision to ask Nepali students to leave was made in response to their protests. “Following the incident, a few Nepali students protested. The university held discussions with them, and the situation was resolved. They accepted the decision and left,” he told ANI.
KIIT University issued a statement acknowledging the incident and said the police acted swiftly. “Immediately after the incident, police investigated the matter and apprehended the culprit. The administration has taken all-out efforts to restore normalcy on campus and in the hostels to resume academic activities,” it said. The university also urged Nepali students who had left to return and resume their studies.

"On way to Kumbh, Bihar women tell railway official 'Modi ji allowed travel without tickets'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/on-way-to-kumbh-bihar-women-tell-railway-official-modi-ji-allowed-travel-without-tickets/articleshow/118327069.cms,Bihar,General News,"Representative image
 
PATNA: A senior railway official in Bihar was left stunned when a group of rural women claimed that they had been allowed to travel without tickets by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The video of the conversation between 
Danapur divisional railway manager
 Jayant Kumar and pilgrims heading for Prayagraj Maha Kumbh, at the Buxar railway station bordering Uttar Pradesh, has gone viral on social media. 
The DRM was inspecting the station on Sunday in view of the higher-than-expected rush of pilgrims visiting the mega congregation, which has also been blamed for the stampede at New Delhi railway station. 
At least 18 people died in the stampede at the packed New Delhi railway station on Saturday night. 
Upon noticing a group of women, of various age groups, standing near railway tracks, the official asked them what were they doing there. They told him that they wanted to catch a train for Prayagraj. 
""Do you have tickets"", asked the DRM, and when the women replied in the negative, he said quizzically, ""Who told you that you can travel without tickets?"". 
Pat came the reply ""Narendra Modi told us so"", evoking a grin from bystanders even as the DRM took a few seconds to regain his composure. 
He told the women, ""You are mistaken. Neither the prime minister nor any other authority has allowed this. If you wish to travel, you must do so after getting tickets, lest you may be charged with breaking the law."" 
Later, talking to reporters, the DRM said, ""For Maha Kumbh, we had made arrangements on a scale that we do at the time of any festive rush. This time what is unusual is that the rush has continued till a time when footfall was expected to have thinned down. Nonetheless, we are prepared."" 
The Maha Kumbh will officially come to a close on February 26, coinciding with the Maha Shivratri festival. 
According to official estimates more than 50 crore people have visited Prayagraj so far for a holy dip in the Sangam, the confluence of Ganga, Yamuna and mythical river Saraswati.

 registered a case against Pakistani national 
Ali Tauqeer Sheikh
 and others under multiple sections of the 
Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita
 (BNS) and the 
Unlawful Activities Prevention Act
 (UAPA), Assam chief minister 
Himanta Biswa Sarma
 announced on Monday.
""In pursuance of the Cabinet decision taken yesterday, Assam Police has lodged an FIR and the same had been registered as CID PS Case No 05/2025 U/S 48/152/61/197(1) BNS, 2023 RW Sec13(1) UA(P) Act against Ali Tauqeer Sheikh and unknown others,"" Sarma said in a post on X.
Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi hit back at the Bharatiya Janata Party, dismissing the actions as diversionary tactics. ""Assam government can conduct any inquiry but we know where we stand,"" the Congress MP said amid controversy over his wife’s 'ISI links'
The Assam chief minister had indicated on Sunday that a police case might also be registered to investigate allegations of Pakistani links of Congress leader 
Akhil Gogoi
’s wife, Elizabeth Colburn, who is a British national. However, the Assam cabinet decided on Sunday not to order a case against her.
The chief minister had said the state government would write to the Centre for probing Colburn's participation in Lok Sabha campaigns, despite being a British citizen, in the erstwhile Kaliabor constituency, which was won by Gogoi twice.
Sarma said that Sheikh had engagements with the Pakistani government and also founded Lead Pakistan, a non-profit organization focusing on climate change. He claimed that Elizabeth Colburn was associated with 
Lead Pakistan
 during her time in Islamabad.
The Assam CM said that various news reports, social media posts, and other public information had surfaced regarding comments made by Sheikh. ""In recent days, multiple news reports, social media posts, and other information in the public domain have surfaced regarding certain comments made by Pakistani national Ali Tauqeer Sheikh aimed at disrupting communal harmony in Assam,"" Sarma said.
He added that an analysis of Sheikh’s social media activity showed ""exhaustive commentary on India's internal affairs and parliamentary matters, raising serious concerns about his intentions to compromise and damage India's interests.""
Sarma said Sheikh had ""deep roots in the government of Pakistan and its leadership,"" having represented Pakistan in international forums and served on committees formed by the Prime Minister of Pakistan. ""Closer examination of information from the public domain reveals that Ali Sheikh is an influential individual with deep roots in the govt of Pakistan and its leadership, having represented Pakistan in international forums. It has come to the attention of the Assam cabinet via publicly available information that Ali Sheikh has served the govt of Pakistan in various advisory positions and on committees constituted by the Prime Minister of Pakistan,"" he said.
Gaurav Gogoi had earlier said that allegations of ""ISI links"" of his wife are being levelled as the Bharatiya Janata Party government ""is trying to hide its unfulfilled promises made to the people of Assam"".
Calling the remarks of the Assam CM as ""baseless, factless, slanderous"", Gogoi said the BJP government has ""no performance to show"".
""They are unable to fulfil any of their promises and in order to hide their failures, they are embarking upon a mischievous, malicious, baseless, factless, slanderous campaign.""

Why did residents hear a loud sound during the earthquake in Delhi?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-did-residents-hear-a-loud-sound-during-the-earthquake-in-delhi/articleshow/118325505.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"NEW DELHI: Tremors of magnitude 4.0 on the Richter Scale hit the Northern part of India early Monday morning. The national capital and its neighbouring areas felt the 
earthquake
 at 5.36 am first followed by another of the same magnitude that jolted Bihar at 8.02 am. 
However, the residents of Delhi-NCR recounted the moment and said they also heard a loud sound.
Poll
What Should Be Your Immediate Action During an Earthquake?
Evacuate The Building Immediately
Drop, Cover, and Hold On
As Delhi-NCR was jolted by an early morning earthquake, National Centre for Seismology director, OP Mishra said, ""The epicentre was at Jheel Park in Dhaula Kuan, it was a 4.0 magnitude earthquake. It was at a depth of 5 km, which is called shallow depth, hence people felt the effect. People getting panicked was natural. Seismologically, it is not a new region, earthquakes have happened earlier in the region. Earlier, there was a 4.6 magnitude earthquake in the 6 km periphery, but it was deeper, with a 10 km depth. There is a difference. It was not a plate tectonic earthquake, it was due to in situ material heterogeneity, and it was due to local effect. We can expect an aftershock of around 1 or 1.2 magnitude.""
Why the loud sound?
Seismologists say the booming noise accompanying the tremors was due to the shallow depth of the earthquake. According to the US Geological Survey (USGS), high-frequency vibrations from shallow-focus quakes generate sound waves as the ground shakes. The closer the quake is to the surface, the more energy and noise it produces. In some cases, even when tremors are not strongly felt, earthquakes can create booming sounds.
Delhi's earthquake risk: A seismic hotspot
Delhi falls under Seismic Zone IV, which signifies a fairly high earthquake risk, as per the Delhi disaster management authority. The region is vulnerable to quakes measuring between 5.0 and 6.0, with occasional tremors reaching magnitudes of 7.0 or higher.
The seismic activity in North India is primarily driven by the collision between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, which store enormous energy before eventually releasing it as earthquakes. Shallow earthquakes, such as the one recorded today, tend to be more damaging due to their proximity to the surface.
The Dhaula Kuan area, the epicentre of today's quake, has a history of minor tremors every two to three years, with a 3.3-magnitude quake recorded in 2015.
Residents recall terrifying moments
The tremors startled many residents in the early hours, with social media flooded with videos and reactions. CCTV footage from a Delhi residence captured water tanks and wires swaying violently as the quake struck.
At New Delhi Railway Station, a passenger likened the tremors to a ""bridge collapse.""
""I was in the waiting lounge when everything started shaking. People rushed outside, thinking something had collapsed,"" he said.
Another resident described the experience as “one of the most intense earthquakes” they had ever felt.
""It was like a train passing right next to my house. Everything was shaking. I've never felt anything like this before,"" they said.
Authorities respond, urge caution
Following the quake, the Delhi Police reassured citizens and urged them to remain cautious. ""We hope you all are safe, Delhi. For emergencies, call 112,"" they posted on X (formerly Twitter).

Centre to set up holding zones at 60 railway stations after Delhi stampede: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-to-set-up-holding-zones-at-60-railway-stations-after-delhi-stampede-report/articleshow/118322850.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"NEW DELHI: The ministry of railways in response to heavy crowding during peak travel seasons is planning to develop permanent holding areas at 60 railway stations to manage passenger flow across the network, according to ANI sources.
The move comes after at least 18 people were killed and several others injured in a stampede at New Delhi Railway Station late Saturday night. The incident occurred when a massive crowd gathered following the announcement of a special train for the Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj. Within minutes, chaos erupted as passengers surged forward, leading to multiple casualties and injuries.
Eyewitnesses reported that the crowd surge was triggered by the delay of two trains, causing an unexpected influx of passengers. As people rushed to board the special train, the situation spiralled out of control, with some passengers fainting amid the crush. This reportedly sparked rumours of a stampede, further intensifying the panic.
With rising concerns over crowd management at major railway hubs, the Centre is now working on creating designated holding zones to prevent such incidents in the future, ANI sources said.

"After drubbing AAP in Delhi, 'Bangal cholo' next for BJP?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-drubbing-aap-in-delhi-bangla-chalo-next-for-bjp/articleshow/118116026.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"PTI photo (File)
 
NEW DELHI: Since 2014, the BJP has been moving from one poll victory to another -- both on the national as well as the state level -- with seemingly nothing able to stand in the way of the Modi wave. 
However, one thorn in BJP's side was Delhi, where the Arvind Kejriwal-led fortress managed to survive the saffron tsunami not once, but twice.
However, 2025 proved to be a breakthrough year as the BJP broke the 27-year-old jinx to storm back to power in the Capital. It defeated the indomitable Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) by winning 48 seats in the 70-member Delhi assembly.
Bristling with confidence after acquiring the Rajdhani in the North, the party has already given clear indications that its next mission is to make inroads in the eastern state of West Bengal.
Like Delhi, making inroads in the Mamata Banerjee-ruled Bengal has been an uphill task for the BJP for the past two assembly elections.
In the 2016 assembly elections, buoyed by the majority mandate at the Centre, the BJP expected to emerge as a key party but faced an embarrassing defeat. The party won only 3 seats in the 294-seat West Bengal assembly.
In 2019, the BJP came back to power at the Centre with an even bigger mandate and by then had a decent presence in even the northeastern states, where BJP had negligible presence before 2014.
Two years down the line, the party made another attempt to breach the fortress of Mamata Banerjee but to no avail. 
In 2021, when the results trickled in, the BJP won only 77 seats with TMC winning a whopping mandate by securing victory on 215 seats. Though the BJP vote and seat share improved substantially, it was far less than the 200-seat mark the party had expected to win in the polls.
Just like Delhi in 2015 and 2020, the BJP fell flat in Bengal in 2016 and 2021.
However, with the BJP finally triumphing in Delhi, Bengal BJP leaders now see the possibility that Bengal may not be ""mission impossible"" anymore.
As BJP was celebrating its victory in the Capital on February 8, its top Bengal leader Suvendu Adhikari shot off a salvo at CM Mamata Banerjee, saying after the national capital, Bengal would vote for the BJP by uprooting ruling TMC.
""Delhi ki jeet hamari hai ... 2026 mein Bengal ki baari hai … (Delhi's victory is ours ... in 2026 it will be Bengal's turn),"" Adhikari said while reacting to BJP's massive comeback after 27 years of political exile.
Pumped by the BJP's historic win in Delhi, Bengal BJP chief and Union minister Sukanta Majumdar said Delhi's victory would serve as a morale booster for party workers in West Bengal ahead of next year's assembly elections.
BJP's Amit Malviya, who heads the party's I-T department, said that ""jitters from the Delhi results are being felt in West Bengal"" and claimed that ""nervous"" Mamata Banerjee would go solo in next year's assembly polls.
""A nervous Mamata Banerjee has told TMC MLAs that there will be NO alliance in Bengal … It is not surprising that she applies a different yardstick to the opposition in Haryana and Delhi but is unwilling to cede space for the alliance at home,"" Malviya wrote on X.

"No discontent in Punjab AAP, asserts Bhagwant Mann; all MLAs attend Delhi meet",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-discontent-in-punjab-aap-asserts-bhagwant-mann-all-mlas-attend-delhi-meet/articleshow/118157908.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"NEW DELHI: Punjab CM 
Bhagwant Mann
 on Tuesday dismissed claims by Congress and BJP of unrest brewing among AAP MLAs, tamping down speculation that the ripples from AAP's Delhi debacle may pose a risk to his govt.
Talking to reporters after the surprise move of party boss Arvind Kejriwal to summon Punjab CM, ministers, MPs and MLAs to Delhi, Mann took on Congress and said ""switching sides is Congress's culture"" and reminded Partap Singh Bajwa, the leader of opposition in Punjab, that his party drew a blank in Delhi.
Ahead of the meeting, which AAP said was attended by all 92 Punjab MLAs, Bajwa had alleged that the party was preparing the ground to oust Mann from the CM's post. He had also claimed that over 30 AAP MLAs were in touch with his party. 
Meeting sparks speculation about instability in 
Punjab AAP
 Instead of counting our MLAs, he should see how many Congress candidates won in Delhi,"" Bhagwant Mann said. Kejriwal and other senior functionaries held a meeting with Punjab functionaries to ostensibly thank them for their involvement in Delhi campaign.
According to AAP, the meeting at Kapurthala House saw all MLAs from Punjab and MPs from the state come together in what the party projected as a show of solidarity and normalcy amid the gloom of the Delhi loss. Besides Kejriwal and former deputy CM Manish Sisodia, national organisational secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Sandeep Pathak and RS MP Raghav Chadha were present.
Kejriwal is learnt to have asked the Punjab MLAs to reconnect with voters while working unitedly to pave the way for AAP's return to office in 2027. The timing of the meeting following AAP's defeat in Delhi had sparked speculation about instability in the party's Punjab unit. Asked about Bajwa's allegation that he could quit AAP with a group of MLAs, Mann said, ""Let them say so. We cultivated the party with hard work by going to every nook and corner of the state. They don't worry about their own party and find fault with others. It is Congress that has a culture of switching parties.""
BJP's newly-elected Rajouri Garden MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa claimed Mann's ""nervousness and body language"" after the meeting ""supports the conspiracy theory"" that he had spoken of on Monday. Sirsa had alleged that Kejriwal was scripting a narrative to oust Mann. 
AAP's estranged RS MP Swati Maliwal also took a dig at Kejriwal and said, ""Some people have started treating Punjab as their personal ATM. Today, massive corruption is rampant in Punjab.""

Delhi Secretariat
 is being prepared to serve as the seat of the new BJP govt in office, with changes to the nameplates of former ministers, repairs, and other maintenance works.

The nameplates of several ministers in the previous govt were removed, and their offices were also being spruced up for the new council of ministers.
The formation of the new govt and the oath-taking ceremony of the chief minister in Delhi are likely to take place after

NEW DELHI: Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann on Tuesday responded to Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa's claim that 30 Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs were in contact with him. 
""Pratap Singh Bajwa has been saying this for almost three years. Let him say whatever he wants. I would ask Pratap Singh Bajwa to count how many MLAs they (Congress) have in Delhi,"" Mann told reporters. 
Mann also said, ""He (Bajwa) has been making claims earlier also that 20 MLAs or 40 MLAs are in touch with him. Let them say it. We have formed this party with our sweat and blood, going among people in villages and towns in the state.""
Poll
Do you agree with the claim made by Congress?
No, it's just political talk
Yes, it seems likely
After AAP's loss in the Delhi assembly elections, Bajwa claimed that an internal struggle would start between Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann and AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal. He also said that over 30 AAP MLAs were in contact with the Congress and were ready to switch sides. 
Congress MP Pramod Tiwari, however, denied that AAP MLAs were in touch with either the BJP or Congress. He said Congress does not support breaking other parties but is observing the political situation in Punjab. 
""BJP has a history of horse-trading and breaking parties—we have seen this in Maharashtra, Goa, Manipur also. They will try to do this in Punjab as well. As far as Congress is concerned, we do not believe in breaking parties. Our party's state leadership is monitoring the situation over there,"" Tiwari said while talking to news agency ANI. 
Earlier in the day, Mann arrived at Kapurthala House in New Delhi for a meeting with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal amid reports of differences within AAP. 
""Our MLAs reached here, and we had a meeting with party national convenor Arvind Kejriwal. He thanked them all for campaigning during the Delhi Assembly elections. Our government in Punjab has always worked for public welfare, whether in education or infrastructure. We need to speed up… Winning and losing is a part of the game. People of Delhi still remember us as someone who worked for them. We have two years more in Punjab. We will make Punjab a good model,"" Mann told the media. 
AAP, which had ruled Delhi for ten years, won only 22 out of 70 seats in the February 5 elections, while the BJP secured a majority, ending AAP's rule in the capital. 
There is also speculation that Kejriwal may take a bigger role in Punjab politics, with discussions about him contesting the vacant Ludhiana Assembly seat. However, AAP MP Malvinder Singh Kang dismissed these reports, calling the meeting a ""routine strategy session."" 
Meanwhile, BJP leader Rohini Vijender Gupta criticized AAP, saying the party is struggling after its defeat in the Delhi elections. 
""Kejriwal is doing a meeting, but it is a sinking ship. They are trying to keep their people together...but it will not last long,"" Gupta said.

This is how BJP celebrated Delhi poll victory in Parliament,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/bjp-celebrates-delhi-poll-victory-with-modi-modi-chants-in-parliament/articleshow/118126100.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"NEW DELHI: BJP's victory in the Delhi polls was hailed by NDA members with chanting of ""Modi, Modi"" slogan in both houses of Parliament on Monday, while former Union minister Anurag Thakur took a jibe at Rahul Gandhi in Lok Sabha over Congress's dismal performance in elections in the capital over the years.
BJP members in Rajya Sabha also ridiculed AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal for having once said that PM Modi would have to be reborn to unseat AAP in Delhi. They also stated that ""people had shown the mirror to those living in Sheesh Mahal"".
Soon after Lok Sabha proceedings started, BJP MPs raised the slogan, to which Congress MPs objected. The sloganeering went on for a while before Speaker Om Birla called for the question hour.
Taking a jibe Rahul in Lok Sabha, Thakur said, ""Rahul Ji, zero check kar lijiye... (Rahul, please check the zero) as Congress has consecutively secured zero seats third time in a row. Referring to Congress' poor track record, he said, ""How many seats did people of Delhi give to Congress in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections? Zero. In 2015? Zero. In 2019? Zero. In 2020? Zero. In 2024? Zero. And in 2025? Zero.""
When proceedings of the upper house began, BJP members started sloganeering in support of PM Modi. However, sloganeering was paused for a while when Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar extended birthday greetings to BJP's Sanjay Seth. It again started, with BJP MPs chanting ""Delhi ke dil me Modi hai, Desh ke dil me Modi hai"".
Meanwhile, BJP MP from Maharashtra Medha Vishram Kulkarni, while praising the budget, referred to its impact in Delhi polls, saying, ""People showed a mirror to those living in Sheesh Mahal.""
Quoting a Hindi couplet, BJP MP Dinesh Sharma, without naming Kejriwal, said his haughtiness got a befitting answer in AAP's stinging defeat. ""The defeat came in this very birth,"" he quipped.
Meanwhile in Lok Sabha, Thakur questioned Congress leaders for not taking a holy dip during the Maha Kumbh and wondered if they had been directed not to do so by ""Uncle Soros and Uncle Sam."" Thakur said even former PM Jawaharlal Nehru took a dip in the Sangam but today's generation of the Congress is avoiding it.

Winning over Jats: How BJP scored a perfect 10 in Delhi elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/winning-over-jats-how-bjp-scored-a-perfect-10/articleshow/118126209.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"A notable win was Parvesh Verma's, which consolidated Jat youth support. Dissatisfaction with AAP's handling of rural problems and a lack of Jat representation in the INDIA bloc also contributed to BJP's success.
 
NEW DELHI: The BJP swept all 10 Jat-dominated constituencies in Delhi into its kitty, capturing territory that they did not have in the last two elections.
Party officials attributed the strong Jat support for the BJP to several factors, particularly the party's focus on addressing rural problems and its willingness to give tickets to several Jat functionaries.
A senior BJP functionary said that there were several problems in Jat-dominated areas, such as registries, a crumbling civic infrastructure, and a need for better connectivity. ""Through DDA and with the support of the lieutenant governor, some work was done. The Jats realised that central govt assistance could play a key role in their development, which was not happening,"" the BJP source said.
Days before the elections, the representatives from all 360 villages of Delhi declared their backing for BJP. Their decision stemmed from a general dissatisfaction with Delhi govt for its failure to resolve issues affecting rural communities.
Another BJP functionary said that giving a ticket to Parvesh Verma also helped, as it led to the consolidation of the community, especially the youth, in BJP's favour. 
He said the bitter political confrontation, when AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal called Verma a traitor for giving money to women through his NGO before the model code of conduct kicked in, also did not help AAP. ""When Kejriwal made personal statements targeting Parvesh Verma through his press briefings, he often made it a Jat issue as well,"" the BJP functionary said.
Also, when Verma was pitched against Kejriwal, it made the contest a battle of personalities, which led to a strong Jat backing for BJP. The BJP also swept outer Delhi seats, which were once the stronghold of his father and former chief minister Sahib Singh Verma.
Another functionary said that having senior Jat functionaries contesting the polls helped in different ways. When AAP raised the issue of Jat reservation, these functionaries were quick to respond that if the party was serious then it should have first brought the proposal in the Vidhan Sabha when it was ruling, but it never did. ""The voices got amplified,"" he said.
Paramjeet Sejwal, who lives in Lado Sarai, said: ""There were several reasons for the BJP's gain. The crumbling infrastructure when not much was happening on the development front was one. Second, people in the community saw leaders such as Kailash Gahlot leaving. Also, the INDIA bloc did not give any ticket to people from the Jat community. So, these factors started consolidating after a point.""
In Lado Sarai, which is part of the Jat-influenced seat of Mehrauli, Gajendra Yadav of BJP won by 1,786 votes. The margins in other seats were larger. In the Jat-dominated seat of Najafgarh, Neelam Pahalwan of BJP won by 29,009 votes against Tarun Kumar of AAP. Last time, AAP got 72,699 votes in this seat.
Gahlot, a former AAP govt minister who switched sides before the polls, won by 11,276 votes against Surendra Bharadwaj of AAP.
In the Palam constituency, a key seat where Jats are in significant numbers, Kuldeep Solanki of BJP won by a margin of 8,952 votes against Joginder Solanki of AAP. The AAP polled 73,094 votes in this seat.
In Nangloi Jat, Manoj Kumar Shokeen of BJP won against Raghuvinder Shokeen of AAP by a margin of 26,251 votes. The party won Narela by 8,596 votes, Rithala by 29,616, Mundka by 10,550 and Nangloi Jat by 26,251. In Vikaspuri, Matiala and Palam also , BJP got good winning margins.

The report is expected to shed light on various issues including irregularities in excise policy, renovation of former CM's residence, and education policies.

The Delhi assembly's first session will begin on February 24, where MLAs will take their oath and elect a new Speaker.
""The report will be tabled in the House and many things will come to light. I think the truth will come out in the CAG report. Whether it is education, liquor, or Sheesh Mahal, many such issues will be raised in the House,"" said Khurana.
Khurana criticized AAP for not presenting the report earlier, emphasizing that the new BJP-led government would operate according to constitutional norms.
""The 8th assembly formed yesterday and its first session will begin tomorrow with the oath of the MLAs and the election of the Speaker and the next day the CAG report will be tabled. This report should have been tabled in the 7th Assembly, as per the rules. But now whatever work the Delhi government will do will be done as per the rules, as per the Constitution,"" Khurana stated.
AAP's national spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar responded by questioning BJP's commitment to their campaign promises, particularly regarding the Rs 2,500 financial assistance scheme for Delhi women.
""BJP should display optimistic politics. They should work on the promises they made to the people of Delhi instead of imposing their agenda. They said that in the first cabinet meeting, a resolution would be passed that every woman in Delhi would get Rs 2500 per month in her account,"" Kakkar said.
Kakkar pointed out that BJP had not addressed their promises in their first cabinet meeting, contrasting this with AAP's record of fulfilling their commitments when they came to power.

MSRTC workers' union said the security of bus drivers and conductors is now at stake.
On Saturday, the MSRTC cancelled 250 buses that operate between Maharashtra and Karnataka in the wake of the violence. Six of these buses operate from Pune. Abhijit Bhosle, the MSRTC public relations officer, said it is not certain whether the buses would operate on Sunday. ""We will take a call after consultation with police. At this moment, nothing can be said,"" the official told TOI. 
As the MSRTC buses towards Karnataka did not ply on Saturday, more than 20 buses from the Kolhapur Central bus stand were cancelled. Passengers were stranded at the bus stand.
Shiv Sena (UBT) workers protested against the incident at the Kolhapur Central bus stand on Saturday morning. They put up saffron flags on the Karnataka State Road Transport buses and raised slogans against the Karnataka govt. Shahupuri police detained the Shiv Sena (UBT) workers.
Vijay Dewane, the district convenor of Shiv Sena (UBT), said, ""The Maharashtra chief minister should immediately stop all the Karnataka buses from entering our state. Karnataka govt should apologise for this act, else a befitting reply will be given.""
The Maharashtra-Karnataka border dispute has been going on for several years now. Whenever the border dispute flares up, the first to bear the brunt often are the state transport buses. 
MSRTC bus conductor Prashant Thorat, who was in the bus that was attacked on Friday, said, ""Our driver, Bhaskar Jadhav, was driving the Bengaluru-Pune MSRTC bus from Chitradurga to Kolhapur when, around 9.30pm, activists of the Karnataka Navanirman Sene turned up in four to five vehicles and blocked the way. The activists, carrying red-yellow flags and scarves, the Jadhav if he could speak in Kannada. When the driver said no, he was pulled out of the bus. His face was blackened. The activists raised slogans screaming ‘If you can't speak Kannada, then you will not be allowed into Karnataka'. Black ink was also splashed on the bus. This continued for half an hour. Our bus was stranded there till 4 am and we, including all the passengers, were very scared as we didn't know the Kannada language either."" 
Repercussions of this incident are now likely to be felt in parts of Maharashtra as well. Uttam Patil, the divisional secretary of the MSRTC workers' union, said, ""There should be coordination between the two states regarding interstate traffic. The number of passengers travelling from Maharashtra to Karnataka is huge. If the corporation takes responsibility for the safety of drivers and conductors, we have no problem in going to Karnataka. MSRTC drivers and the general public are being dragged into the organisational and political tussle. The transport corporations of both states should sit together and decide on safety.""

Delhi govt to table CAG reports on February 25; Arvinder Singh Lovely appointed as pro tem speaker,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-govt-to-table-cag-reports-on-february-25/articleshow/118479158.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"In her first press briefing as Delhi CM , Rekha Gupta had said that her government will table the CAG reports in the first Assembly session.
 
NEW DELHI: The 
Delhi government
 will table the long-pending Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) reports in the Assembly on February 25. The reports, which examine the financial and administrative performance of the previous 
Aam Aadmi Party
 (AAP) government, had been at the centre of a political tussle between the two parties.
Delhi LG VK Saxena has appointed 
BJP
 MLA Arvinder Singh Lovely as the pro tem speaker of the Delhi assembly.
According to the legislative assembly bulletin, the first session of the eighth Delhi Assembly will commence on 24th February, with the oath-taking ceremony for newly elected MLAs in the morning, followed by the election of the Speaker in the afternoon. On 25th February, Lieutenant Governor V K Saxena will address the House, after which the 
CAG reports
 will be presented. The session will reconvene on 27th February for discussions on the motion of thanks and the election of the Deputy Speaker.
BJP MLA Vijender Gupta, who has been elected as the Speaker, had confirmed the tabling of the CAG reports. ""The CAG reports will be tabled on 25th February,"" he said in a post on X after meeting Delhi chief minister 
Rekha Gupta
 to discuss the agenda of the upcoming session. 
The BJP had previously accused the AAP government of deliberately stalling the release of the reports to conceal corruption. During AAP's rule, the party had moved court seeking directions for the reports to be tabled, a demand that is now being fulfilled under the BJP-led administration.
Rekha Gupta, who took office as Delhi chief minister on February 20, had defended her government's swift decisions amid criticism from opposition parties. ""The Congress ruled for 15 years and AAP for 13. Instead of questioning us, they should reflect on their own record. Within a day of taking office, we cleared the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, which AAP had blocked, providing Rs 10 lakh in benefits to Delhi residents,"" she stated.
She also took aim at the opposition, suggesting that the CAG reports could reveal damaging details about the previous administration. ""They are worried that once the CAG reports are tabled, many records will be exposed,"" she said.
In addition to addressing financial transparency, the BJP government has pledged to prioritise pollution control and infrastructure projects. After participating in the evening Aarti on the Yamuna’s banks, Rekha Gupta reiterated her commitment to cleaning the river, a key issue during the Assembly elections. The BJP had previously criticised AAP for failing to address pollution and encroachment along the river.

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has imposed a 10-year rigorous imprisonment sentence on a man found guilty of kidnapping and raping a toddler in 2019. Additional Sessions Judge Manoj Kumar asserted that judicial verdicts should mirror society's contempt for those who sexually prey on children.
The court's judgement dated January 15 highlighted that the 
POCSO Act 2012
 was enacted in response to increasing crimes against children and public demand for justice.
The verdict stated, ""Hence, the abhorrence that society as a whole has towards sexual predators targeting children also should find reflection in the judgments of the courts.""
The court noted that the 31-year-old convict was young with potential for rehabilitation and had no prior criminal record.
""On the other hand, the convict has committed the offence of 
aggravated penetrative sexual assault
 or rape upon the victim girl aged one-and-a-half years. Thus, the act of the convict is bound to have serious consequences on the mental health of the victim and would affect her normal life,"" it said, according to news agency PTI.
The convict received concurrent sentences: 10 years of rigorous imprisonment under POCSO Act Section 6 and three years for kidnapping.
The court granted Rs 13.5 lakh compensation, noting that criminal justice aims not only to punish offenders appropriately but also to support victims' rehabilitation from permanent physical and psychological trauma.

"'Congress and AAP never addressed issues of people of Delhi,' says CM Rekha Gupta",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-and-aap-never-addressed-issues-of-people-of-delhi-says-cm-rekha-gupta/articleshow/118443405.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"Delhi CM Rekha Gupta
 
NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister 
Rekha Gupta
 on Friday criticised the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party for failing to address the issues of Delhi residents during their respective tenures, specifying that her government approved the 
Ayushman Bharat scheme
 on its first day in office.
Gupta, who was sworn-in on Thursday along with six other ministers, marked the BJP's return to power in the capital after more than 26 years.
Accusing the Congress and AAP of neglecting the people of Delhi, Gupta said, ""Congress ruled Delhi for 15 years and after that it was the AAP... yet, they never addressed the issues of the people of Delhi. And now, just one day after we took office, they have started questioning our government.""
Highlighting her party's swift action, she mentioned, “We approved the Ayushman Bharat 
health insurance scheme
 in our first cabinet meeting—a scheme AAP stalled for years. We took oath and immediately fulfilled this promise.” 
Gupta suggested that Congress and AAP should focus on their internal matters, stating, “Many of their members are ready to leave, and they are worried because we are committed to fulfilling all our promises.” 
She also claimed that the opposition feared her government’s transparency. “They are scared because we will present reports in the first assembly session that were never submitted before. The truth about their actions will be revealed to the people,” she said. 
Reaffirming her commitment to the public, Gupta assured that her government would keep all its promises. “We started our work on day one by visiting Yamuna Ghat, and we are determined to fulfill 100 percent of our commitments,” she added.

'Rise above political differences': Dharmendra Pradhan hits back at Stalin on NEP row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rise-above-political-differences-dharmendra-pradhan-hits-back-at-stalin-on-nep-row/articleshow/118442782.cms,Madhya Pradesh,Dhar,"MK Stalin and Dharmendra Pradhan (File photo)
 
NEW DELHI: In response to 
MK Stalin
's letter to Prime Minister 
Narendra Modi
, Union minister and BJP leader 
Dharmendra Pradhan
 on Friday wrote to the Tamil Nadu CM, clarifying that the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 does not mandate any language.
He targeted the Tamil Nadu CM for interpreting 
NEP 2020
 with a ""myopic vision"" and for portraying progressive educational reforms as political threats. Pradhan also stated that the chief minister's letter to PM contradicted the spirit of cooperative federalism.
Pradhan urged the Tamil Nadu government to ""rise above political differences for the interest of young learners."" He also added, ""By not implementing NEP 2020, we are depriving our students, teachers, and parents of global and pan-India opportunities. Rejecting a student-centric, future-focused policy is really regressive. Education should not be politicized. Misrepresented facts won’t solve anything. Even many non-BJP states are implementing NEP, taking full cooperation from the federal government. Tamil Nadu is losing out on Rs 5,000 crore by not implementing PM Shri Schools, which focus on scientific education and teaching methods in the Tamil language."" 
Earlier today, on International Mother Language Day, CM Stalin posted on X, saying, “We should protect our mother tongues from our foes. Tamil is our virtue. Tamil is our protection.”
In his letter to the Prime Minister on Thursday, Stalin expressed concerns over Union education minister Pradhan's statement that Tamil Nadu's 'Samagra Shiksha' funds would not be released unless the state implements the 'three-language' policy outlined in NEP 2020.
Meanwhile, BJP's Tamil Nadu chief Annamalai supported the 
three-language policy
, saying that learning a third language is beneficial for Tamil Nadu. He also accused the DMK and its allies of misleading the public by claiming that Hindi would be mandatory under the new education policy. 
On Tuesday, deputy CM Udhayanidhi Stalin argued that “Hindi will destroy Tamil like it did many North Indian languages.” 
The INDIA bloc parties united to protest against the BJP-led central government, accusing it of encroaching on state rights, denying funds in the Union Budget, and withholding educational funds for Tamil Nadu.
""Hindi destroyed the local languages of states in the north such as Rajasthani, Haryanvi, Bhojpuri, and other Bihari languages and has become the primary local language. The same will happen if Hindi is implemented in Tamil Nadu too. Almost 99% of Tamils who are now working abroad and in prestigious organisations such as Isro were from govt schools who did not study Hindi,"" Udhayanidhi said at the protest.

'Congress B team of BJP in Delhi polls': Mayawati renews attack on Rahul Gandhi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-b-team-of-bjp-in-delhi-polls-mayawati-renews-attack-on-rahul-gandhi/articleshow/118440852.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"Mayawati and Rahul Gandhi (File photo)
 
NEW DELHI: Continuing her verbal battle with Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi, Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati on Friday accused Congress of acting as BJP's ""B team"" in the recent Delhi assembly elections, contributing to BJP's victory.
In a post on X, Mayawati said, ""It is a common discussion that this time Congress contested the Delhi Assembly elections as BJP's B team, due to which BJP has come to power here. Otherwise, Congress' condition would not have been so bad in this election that this party could not even save the deposit of most of its candidates.""
Mayawati also took a jab at Rahul Gandhi, advising him to introspect rather than blame others. She said, ""It would be better if Rahul Gandhi looks into himself before pointing fingers at others, especially at the BSP chief. This is my advice to him""
The BSP supremo also warned the newly formed BJP government in Delhi to fulfill its electoral promises, cautioning that failure could result in a fate similar to Congress's decline. 
""The new BJP government formed in Delhi has the challenge of fulfilling all the promises made during the elections, especially those related to public welfare and development, on time, otherwise, the condition of this party may also become as bad as that of Congress in the future,"" Mayawati's post on X read.
In the Delhi elections held on February 5, the BJP secured a strong majority with 48 seats, ending AAP's decade-long rule and leaving Congress with no seats. 
Earlier on Thursday, Rahul Gandhi questioned Mayawati's electoral strategy, asking, ""Why doesn't Mayawati fight elections properly?"" He added, ""We wanted Behenji to join us in the fight against BJP."" 
Expressing his disappointment, Gandhi said, ""For some reason, Mayawati Ji isn't contesting, which disappoints us greatly. If all three parties came together, the BJP would never win."" He also noted that the doors of the INDIA alliance remain open for her.
Mayawati countered, accusing Congress of ""double standards"". She claimed Congress displays ""animosity and casteist attitude"" towards BSP where it's strong but talks of alliance where it's weak, like in Uttar Pradesh.
Mayawati asserted that BSP has suffered in past alliances with Congress as its vote base didn’t transfer to BSP, leading to electoral losses.

Foreign minister S Jaishankar
 met 
Bangladesh foreign adviser
 Touhid Hossain on the sidelines of Indian Ocean Conference in Muscat on Sunday amid tense bilateral ties over the presence of ousted ex-PM Sheikh Hasina in India since last August.
While Jaishankar said the conversation was focused on the bilateral relationship and cooperation under 
Bimstec
, a Bangladesh readout said Hossain requested India to consider a huddle of Saarc standing committee that hasn't met since the 2016 Uri attack when India decided to block the process because of Pakistan's support to cross-border terror.
Sunday's talks come ahead of a possible meeting between PM Modi and Bangladesh chief adviser Md Yunus on the margins of Bimstec summit in Thailand on April 3-4.
India attempts to promote Bimstec, which excludes Pakistan
 If it happens, it would be the first bilateral meeting between the two after Yunus assumed office. Both Modi and Yunus are likely to attend the Bimstec summit in person. Modi had discussed concerns related to Bangladesh in the meeting with Trump last week.
In his meeting with Jaishankar, Hossain also called for talks for renewal of 
Ganges Water Treaty
, adding both sides recognised the challenges in the relationship and the need for joint efforts to address those.
According to Dhaka, ahead of talks between border forces this week, it was hoped that various border related issues would be discussed and resolved during the meeting. Both sides recognised the challenges the two neighbours are facing in terms of bilateral relations and discussed the necessity to work together to address those, it said in its statement on the Jaishankar-Hossain meeting. Jaishankar also met his counterparts from other Bimstec member-states like Nepal and Bhutan in Muscat. India has sought to promote the inter-regional Bimstec, which excludes Pakistan and counts Thailand as a member, as a more relevant forum for regional cooperation and connectivity, as Saarc remains practically defunct.
The mention of Bimstec in Jaishankar's post is important also because Bangladesh will officially take over as the chair of the group from Thailand at the summit. 
""As the chair, Bangladesh will have the opportunity to lead Bimstec, take initiatives for cooperation in different sectors by working together in tandem with all the member states and this will be an opportunity for Bangladesh to re-demonstrate its commitment to the world,"" said Bimstec secretary-general I M Pandey last week.
Jaishankar is learnt to have conveyed India's desire for a constructive and mutually beneficial relationship with Bangladesh in a positive atmosphere.

DEHRADUN: Over 45% of Himachal Pradesh's area is highly prone to natural disasters such as floods, landslides, and avalanches, according to a study by researchers from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Ropar. The team recently completed a hazard susceptibility mapping of the state as part of a broader effort by researchers and scientists from multiple IITs to assess multi-hazard vulnerability across the Himalayan states. The goal is to identify regions at high risk from multiple natural hazards simultaneously and aid in targeted 
disaster risk reduction strategies
.

What Is the Most Effective Way to Mitigate Natural Disaster Risks?

Early Warning Systems and Emergency Preparedness
The IIT Ropar team presented its findings at the 2nd Indian Cryosphere Meet (ICM), held at IIT Bombay on Feb 14-15, which was attended by nearly 80 glaciologists, researchers, and scientists from around the world.
The study, conducted by MTech scholar Daishisha Iawphniaw under the guidance of Reet Kamal Tiwari, an associate professor at IIT Ropar, used geospatial data to evaluate the state's vulnerability. Tiwari told TOI, ""The study found that areas with mean slopes between 5.9 degrees and 16.4 degrees and elevations up to 1,600 metres are particularly prone to both landslides and floods. Meanwhile, higher-altitude regions with slopes between 16.8 degrees and 41.5 degrees are more likely to experience both avalanches and landslides."" He added that steep mountain slopes and elevations above 3,000 metres are at the ""highest risk"". Using GIS-based mapping, the study classified hazard-prone regions, showing that flood and landslide-prone zones are typically located in lower-elevation river valleys, while high-altitude mountains face a greater threat of avalanches.
The study also highlighted how one hazard can trigger another due to shared underlying causes and stressed that having this knowledge is crucial for improving disaster planning and risk management.
Tiwari said studies to assess multi-hazard vulnerability are being conducted in Uttarakhand, J&K, and northeast states. ""For Uttarakhand, we are collaborating with IIT Roorkee to conduct the study,"" he said.

New Delhi railway station
, Northern Railway enforced a number of measures to avoid any such untoward incident in the days to come. It has been decided that all special trains in the direction of Prayagraj will be run from platform number 16. Therefore all the passengers wanting to go to Prayagraj shall come and go from Ajmeri Gate side of New Delhi railway station. Regular trains will continue to be operated from all platforms as the regular practice is. This is a step in the direction of avoiding peak hour rush getting accumulated in one platform, as per an official statement from the Ministry of Railways. 
In addition, the deployment of RPF & GRP forces in New Delhi Railway station has been increased. These personnel assist the passengers by helping them towards the platform from which their train is scheduled to depart. In addition to the focus on increased operational efficiency in rush hours, Northern Railways ran three special trains by evening 7 pm to clear the additional rush in the direction of Prayagraj. This includes one special train to Darbhanga via Prayagraj and two more special trains towards Prayagraj. Besides regular trains towards Prayagraj one more special Train is scheduled to depart at 9 pm to cater to the peak evening hour demand. Given the unprecedented crowd of travellers wanting to go in the direction of Prayagraj, the Indian Railway has scheduled five more special trains Tomorrow, i.e. February 17, for Mahakumbh devotees.
In order to avoid any untoward incident in future, Indian Railways appeals through media outlets to the public at large not to fall prey to rumours as was witnessed in the unfortunate incident at New Delhi railway station yesterday. All the travellers are requested not to change platforms on hearsay and strictly follow the official announcement. Indian Railway seeks the cooperation of passengers by adhering to the operational planning of Indian Railways. This will go a long way and help zonal railway authorities to smoothly execute planned regular & special train services for commuters.
Railways Helpline no 139 continues to serve people to reach out for any enquiry and passenger support during ongoing rush situations. Indian Railways has received more than 130 calls relating to yesterday's unfortunate incident on this helpline number by 5 PM today.

BJP's legislative party to meet on February 19: Who will be Delhi's next CM?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjps-legislative-party-to-meet-tomorrow-who-will-be-delhis-next-cm/articleshow/118305518.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"NEW DELHI: After a historic victory in the Delhi Assembly elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is now gearing up for a major decision: who will become the next chief minister of Delhi? The party secured a commanding 48 seats out of 70, sweeping the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) aside and ending its decade-long rule in the capital. 
BJP Legislature Party meeting scheduled for tomorrow, February 17, was postponed. Now this meeting will be held on February 19. The swearing-in ceremony of the chief minister will also be held on 20th February instead of 18th February, ANI reported quoting sources.
BJP's return to power in Delhi after 27 years has raised anticipation over the leadership choice. While several names have been floated, sources suggest the party is likely to select a leader from among the winning MLAs to avoid the necessity of byelections. 
Parvesh Verma has emerged as a strong contender following his victory over Arvind Kejriwal in the New Delhi constituency. The son of former chief minister Saheb Singh Verma, Parvesh has twice won the West Delhi Lok Sabha seat and is seen as a strong representative of the Jat community, which played a crucial role in the BJP's electoral success.

Delhi CM likely to be an MLA; Parvesh Verma, Vijender Gupta in race
Vijender Gupta, the leader of the BJP in the outgoing Assembly, is also being considered. Gupta secured his third consecutive victory from Rohini and is seen as an experienced leader capable of leading the state government. Additionally, former Delhi BJP chiefs Satish Upadhyay and Virendra Sachdeva have been named as potential choices. 
The BJP has a history of making unexpected choices for key leadership roles, often selecting lesser-known figures to introduce fresh perspectives. This has fuelled speculation that the party might opt for an unconventional pick. Some reports suggest the possibility of appointing two deputy chief ministers, a strategy previously used in states like uttar pradesh and madhya pradesh to ensure broad community representation.
Another name gaining traction is Bansuri Swaraj, the daughter of the late Sushma Swaraj. A prominent lawyer, she has been actively involved in BJP's campaign efforts and secured a victory in the New Delhi constituency during the Lok Sabha elections.
Harish Khurana, son of former chief minister Madan Lal Khurana, is also in the running after securing a decisive win against AAP's Shiv Charan Goel. Like Parvesh Verma, he carries strong political lineage and has been a dedicated party worker for years.
The recent election results marked a major setback for AAP, which had ruled Delhi for a decade. The BJP secured a two-thirds majority, winning 48 out of 70 seats, while AAP managed to win only 22. Arvind Kejriwal’s defeat in the New Delhi constituency by Parvesh Verma symbolised the party’s declining fortune, with key AAP leaders, including Manish Sisodia and Satyendar Jain, also losing their seats.

"After drubbing AAP in Delhi, 'Bangal cholo' next for BJP?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-drubbing-aap-in-delhi-bangla-chalo-next-for-bjp/articleshow/118116026.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"PTI photo (File)
 
NEW DELHI: Since 2014, the BJP has been moving from one poll victory to another -- both on the national as well as the state level -- with seemingly nothing able to stand in the way of the Modi wave. 
However, one thorn in BJP's side was Delhi, where the Arvind Kejriwal-led fortress managed to survive the saffron tsunami not once, but twice.
However, 2025 proved to be a breakthrough year as the BJP broke the 27-year-old jinx to storm back to power in the Capital. It defeated the indomitable Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) by winning 48 seats in the 70-member Delhi assembly.
Bristling with confidence after acquiring the Rajdhani in the North, the party has already given clear indications that its next mission is to make inroads in the eastern state of West Bengal.
Like Delhi, making inroads in the Mamata Banerjee-ruled Bengal has been an uphill task for the BJP for the past two assembly elections.
In the 2016 assembly elections, buoyed by the majority mandate at the Centre, the BJP expected to emerge as a key party but faced an embarrassing defeat. The party won only 3 seats in the 294-seat West Bengal assembly.
In 2019, the BJP came back to power at the Centre with an even bigger mandate and by then had a decent presence in even the northeastern states, where BJP had negligible presence before 2014.
Two years down the line, the party made another attempt to breach the fortress of Mamata Banerjee but to no avail. 
In 2021, when the results trickled in, the BJP won only 77 seats with TMC winning a whopping mandate by securing victory on 215 seats. Though the BJP vote and seat share improved substantially, it was far less than the 200-seat mark the party had expected to win in the polls.
Just like Delhi in 2015 and 2020, the BJP fell flat in Bengal in 2016 and 2021.
However, with the BJP finally triumphing in Delhi, Bengal BJP leaders now see the possibility that Bengal may not be ""mission impossible"" anymore.
As BJP was celebrating its victory in the Capital on February 8, its top Bengal leader Suvendu Adhikari shot off a salvo at CM Mamata Banerjee, saying after the national capital, Bengal would vote for the BJP by uprooting ruling TMC.
""Delhi ki jeet hamari hai ... 2026 mein Bengal ki baari hai … (Delhi's victory is ours ... in 2026 it will be Bengal's turn),"" Adhikari said while reacting to BJP's massive comeback after 27 years of political exile.
Pumped by the BJP's historic win in Delhi, Bengal BJP chief and Union minister Sukanta Majumdar said Delhi's victory would serve as a morale booster for party workers in West Bengal ahead of next year's assembly elections.
BJP's Amit Malviya, who heads the party's I-T department, said that ""jitters from the Delhi results are being felt in West Bengal"" and claimed that ""nervous"" Mamata Banerjee would go solo in next year's assembly polls.
""A nervous Mamata Banerjee has told TMC MLAs that there will be NO alliance in Bengal … It is not surprising that she applies a different yardstick to the opposition in Haryana and Delhi but is unwilling to cede space for the alliance at home,"" Malviya wrote on X.

"No discontent in Punjab AAP, asserts Bhagwant Mann; all MLAs attend Delhi meet",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-discontent-in-punjab-aap-asserts-bhagwant-mann-all-mlas-attend-delhi-meet/articleshow/118157908.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"NEW DELHI: Punjab CM 
Bhagwant Mann
 on Tuesday dismissed claims by Congress and BJP of unrest brewing among AAP MLAs, tamping down speculation that the ripples from AAP's Delhi debacle may pose a risk to his govt.
Talking to reporters after the surprise move of party boss Arvind Kejriwal to summon Punjab CM, ministers, MPs and MLAs to Delhi, Mann took on Congress and said ""switching sides is Congress's culture"" and reminded Partap Singh Bajwa, the leader of opposition in Punjab, that his party drew a blank in Delhi.
Ahead of the meeting, which AAP said was attended by all 92 Punjab MLAs, Bajwa had alleged that the party was preparing the ground to oust Mann from the CM's post. He had also claimed that over 30 AAP MLAs were in touch with his party. 
Meeting sparks speculation about instability in 
Punjab AAP
 Instead of counting our MLAs, he should see how many Congress candidates won in Delhi,"" Bhagwant Mann said. Kejriwal and other senior functionaries held a meeting with Punjab functionaries to ostensibly thank them for their involvement in Delhi campaign.
According to AAP, the meeting at Kapurthala House saw all MLAs from Punjab and MPs from the state come together in what the party projected as a show of solidarity and normalcy amid the gloom of the Delhi loss. Besides Kejriwal and former deputy CM Manish Sisodia, national organisational secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Sandeep Pathak and RS MP Raghav Chadha were present.
Kejriwal is learnt to have asked the Punjab MLAs to reconnect with voters while working unitedly to pave the way for AAP's return to office in 2027. The timing of the meeting following AAP's defeat in Delhi had sparked speculation about instability in the party's Punjab unit. Asked about Bajwa's allegation that he could quit AAP with a group of MLAs, Mann said, ""Let them say so. We cultivated the party with hard work by going to every nook and corner of the state. They don't worry about their own party and find fault with others. It is Congress that has a culture of switching parties.""
BJP's newly-elected Rajouri Garden MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa claimed Mann's ""nervousness and body language"" after the meeting ""supports the conspiracy theory"" that he had spoken of on Monday. Sirsa had alleged that Kejriwal was scripting a narrative to oust Mann. 
AAP's estranged RS MP Swati Maliwal also took a dig at Kejriwal and said, ""Some people have started treating Punjab as their personal ATM. Today, massive corruption is rampant in Punjab.""

NEW DELHI: Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann on Tuesday responded to Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa's claim that 30 Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs were in contact with him. 
""Pratap Singh Bajwa has been saying this for almost three years. Let him say whatever he wants. I would ask Pratap Singh Bajwa to count how many MLAs they (Congress) have in Delhi,"" Mann told reporters. 
Mann also said, ""He (Bajwa) has been making claims earlier also that 20 MLAs or 40 MLAs are in touch with him. Let them say it. We have formed this party with our sweat and blood, going among people in villages and towns in the state.""
Poll
Do you agree with the claim made by Congress?
No, it's just political talk
Yes, it seems likely
After AAP's loss in the Delhi assembly elections, Bajwa claimed that an internal struggle would start between Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann and AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal. He also said that over 30 AAP MLAs were in contact with the Congress and were ready to switch sides. 
Congress MP Pramod Tiwari, however, denied that AAP MLAs were in touch with either the BJP or Congress. He said Congress does not support breaking other parties but is observing the political situation in Punjab. 
""BJP has a history of horse-trading and breaking parties—we have seen this in Maharashtra, Goa, Manipur also. They will try to do this in Punjab as well. As far as Congress is concerned, we do not believe in breaking parties. Our party's state leadership is monitoring the situation over there,"" Tiwari said while talking to news agency ANI. 
Earlier in the day, Mann arrived at Kapurthala House in New Delhi for a meeting with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal amid reports of differences within AAP. 
""Our MLAs reached here, and we had a meeting with party national convenor Arvind Kejriwal. He thanked them all for campaigning during the Delhi Assembly elections. Our government in Punjab has always worked for public welfare, whether in education or infrastructure. We need to speed up… Winning and losing is a part of the game. People of Delhi still remember us as someone who worked for them. We have two years more in Punjab. We will make Punjab a good model,"" Mann told the media. 
AAP, which had ruled Delhi for ten years, won only 22 out of 70 seats in the February 5 elections, while the BJP secured a majority, ending AAP's rule in the capital. 
There is also speculation that Kejriwal may take a bigger role in Punjab politics, with discussions about him contesting the vacant Ludhiana Assembly seat. However, AAP MP Malvinder Singh Kang dismissed these reports, calling the meeting a ""routine strategy session."" 
Meanwhile, BJP leader Rohini Vijender Gupta criticized AAP, saying the party is struggling after its defeat in the Delhi elections. 
""Kejriwal is doing a meeting, but it is a sinking ship. They are trying to keep their people together...but it will not last long,"" Gupta said.

This is how BJP celebrated Delhi poll victory in Parliament,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/bjp-celebrates-delhi-poll-victory-with-modi-modi-chants-in-parliament/articleshow/118126100.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"NEW DELHI: BJP's victory in the Delhi polls was hailed by NDA members with chanting of ""Modi, Modi"" slogan in both houses of Parliament on Monday, while former Union minister Anurag Thakur took a jibe at Rahul Gandhi in Lok Sabha over Congress's dismal performance in elections in the capital over the years.
BJP members in Rajya Sabha also ridiculed AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal for having once said that PM Modi would have to be reborn to unseat AAP in Delhi. They also stated that ""people had shown the mirror to those living in Sheesh Mahal"".
Soon after Lok Sabha proceedings started, BJP MPs raised the slogan, to which Congress MPs objected. The sloganeering went on for a while before Speaker Om Birla called for the question hour.
Taking a jibe Rahul in Lok Sabha, Thakur said, ""Rahul Ji, zero check kar lijiye... (Rahul, please check the zero) as Congress has consecutively secured zero seats third time in a row. Referring to Congress' poor track record, he said, ""How many seats did people of Delhi give to Congress in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections? Zero. In 2015? Zero. In 2019? Zero. In 2020? Zero. In 2024? Zero. And in 2025? Zero.""
When proceedings of the upper house began, BJP members started sloganeering in support of PM Modi. However, sloganeering was paused for a while when Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar extended birthday greetings to BJP's Sanjay Seth. It again started, with BJP MPs chanting ""Delhi ke dil me Modi hai, Desh ke dil me Modi hai"".
Meanwhile, BJP MP from Maharashtra Medha Vishram Kulkarni, while praising the budget, referred to its impact in Delhi polls, saying, ""People showed a mirror to those living in Sheesh Mahal.""
Quoting a Hindi couplet, BJP MP Dinesh Sharma, without naming Kejriwal, said his haughtiness got a befitting answer in AAP's stinging defeat. ""The defeat came in this very birth,"" he quipped.
Meanwhile in Lok Sabha, Thakur questioned Congress leaders for not taking a holy dip during the Maha Kumbh and wondered if they had been directed not to do so by ""Uncle Soros and Uncle Sam."" Thakur said even former PM Jawaharlal Nehru took a dip in the Sangam but today's generation of the Congress is avoiding it.

Winning over Jats: How BJP scored a perfect 10 in Delhi elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/winning-over-jats-how-bjp-scored-a-perfect-10/articleshow/118126209.cms,Delhi,Delhi,"A notable win was Parvesh Verma's, which consolidated Jat youth support. Dissatisfaction with AAP's handling of rural problems and a lack of Jat representation in the INDIA bloc also contributed to BJP's success.
 
NEW DELHI: The BJP swept all 10 Jat-dominated constituencies in Delhi into its kitty, capturing territory that they did not have in the last two elections.
Party officials attributed the strong Jat support for the BJP to several factors, particularly the party's focus on addressing rural problems and its willingness to give tickets to several Jat functionaries.
A senior BJP functionary said that there were several problems in Jat-dominated areas, such as registries, a crumbling civic infrastructure, and a need for better connectivity. ""Through DDA and with the support of the lieutenant governor, some work was done. The Jats realised that central govt assistance could play a key role in their development, which was not happening,"" the BJP source said.
Days before the elections, the representatives from all 360 villages of Delhi declared their backing for BJP. Their decision stemmed from a general dissatisfaction with Delhi govt for its failure to resolve issues affecting rural communities.
Another BJP functionary said that giving a ticket to Parvesh Verma also helped, as it led to the consolidation of the community, especially the youth, in BJP's favour. 
He said the bitter political confrontation, when AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal called Verma a traitor for giving money to women through his NGO before the model code of conduct kicked in, also did not help AAP. ""When Kejriwal made personal statements targeting Parvesh Verma through his press briefings, he often made it a Jat issue as well,"" the BJP functionary said.
Also, when Verma was pitched against Kejriwal, it made the contest a battle of personalities, which led to a strong Jat backing for BJP. The BJP also swept outer Delhi seats, which were once the stronghold of his father and former chief minister Sahib Singh Verma.
Another functionary said that having senior Jat functionaries contesting the polls helped in different ways. When AAP raised the issue of Jat reservation, these functionaries were quick to respond that if the party was serious then it should have first brought the proposal in the Vidhan Sabha when it was ruling, but it never did. ""The voices got amplified,"" he said.
Paramjeet Sejwal, who lives in Lado Sarai, said: ""There were several reasons for the BJP's gain. The crumbling infrastructure when not much was happening on the development front was one. Second, people in the community saw leaders such as Kailash Gahlot leaving. Also, the INDIA bloc did not give any ticket to people from the Jat community. So, these factors started consolidating after a point.""
In Lado Sarai, which is part of the Jat-influenced seat of Mehrauli, Gajendra Yadav of BJP won by 1,786 votes. The margins in other seats were larger. In the Jat-dominated seat of Najafgarh, Neelam Pahalwan of BJP won by 29,009 votes against Tarun Kumar of AAP. Last time, AAP got 72,699 votes in this seat.
Gahlot, a former AAP govt minister who switched sides before the polls, won by 11,276 votes against Surendra Bharadwaj of AAP.
In the Palam constituency, a key seat where Jats are in significant numbers, Kuldeep Solanki of BJP won by a margin of 8,952 votes against Joginder Solanki of AAP. The AAP polled 73,094 votes in this seat.
In Nangloi Jat, Manoj Kumar Shokeen of BJP won against Raghuvinder Shokeen of AAP by a margin of 26,251 votes. The party won Narela by 8,596 votes, Rithala by 29,616, Mundka by 10,550 and Nangloi Jat by 26,251. In Vikaspuri, Matiala and Palam also , BJP got good winning margins.

The report is expected to shed light on various issues including irregularities in excise policy, renovation of former CM's residence, and education policies.

The Delhi assembly's first session will begin on February 24, where MLAs will take their oath and elect a new Speaker.
""The report will be tabled in the House and many things will come to light. I think the truth will come out in the CAG report. Whether it is education, liquor, or Sheesh Mahal, many such issues will be raised in the House,"" said Khurana.
Khurana criticized AAP for not presenting the report earlier, emphasizing that the new BJP-led government would operate according to constitutional norms.
""The 8th assembly formed yesterday and its first session will begin tomorrow with the oath of the MLAs and the election of the Speaker and the next day the CAG report will be tabled. This report should have been tabled in the 7th Assembly, as per the rules. But now whatever work the Delhi government will do will be done as per the rules, as per the Constitution,"" Khurana stated.
AAP's national spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar responded by questioning BJP's commitment to their campaign promises, particularly regarding the Rs 2,500 financial assistance scheme for Delhi women.
""BJP should display optimistic politics. They should work on the promises they made to the people of Delhi instead of imposing their agenda. They said that in the first cabinet meeting, a resolution would be passed that every woman in Delhi would get Rs 2500 per month in her account,"" Kakkar said.
Kakkar pointed out that BJP had not addressed their promises in their first cabinet meeting, contrasting this with AAP's record of fulfilling their commitments when they came to power.

MSRTC workers' union said the security of bus drivers and conductors is now at stake.
On Saturday, the MSRTC cancelled 250 buses that operate between Maharashtra and Karnataka in the wake of the violence. Six of these buses operate from Pune. Abhijit Bhosle, the MSRTC public relations officer, said it is not certain whether the buses would operate on Sunday. ""We will take a call after consultation with police. At this moment, nothing can be said,"" the official told TOI. 
As the MSRTC buses towards Karnataka did not ply on Saturday, more than 20 buses from the Kolhapur Central bus stand were cancelled. Passengers were stranded at the bus stand.
Shiv Sena (UBT) workers protested against the incident at the Kolhapur Central bus stand on Saturday morning. They put up saffron flags on the Karnataka State Road Transport buses and raised slogans against the Karnataka govt. Shahupuri police detained the Shiv Sena (UBT) workers.
Vijay Dewane, the district convenor of Shiv Sena (UBT), said, ""The Maharashtra chief minister should immediately stop all the Karnataka buses from entering our state. Karnataka govt should apologise for this act, else a befitting reply will be given.""
The Maharashtra-Karnataka border dispute has been going on for several years now. Whenever the border dispute flares up, the first to bear the brunt often are the state transport buses. 
MSRTC bus conductor Prashant Thorat, who was in the bus that was attacked on Friday, said, ""Our driver, Bhaskar Jadhav, was driving the Bengaluru-Pune MSRTC bus from Chitradurga to Kolhapur when, around 9.30pm, activists of the Karnataka Navanirman Sene turned up in four to five vehicles and blocked the way. The activists, carrying red-yellow flags and scarves, the Jadhav if he could speak in Kannada. When the driver said no, he was pulled out of the bus. His face was blackened. The activists raised slogans screaming ‘If you can't speak Kannada, then you will not be allowed into Karnataka'. Black ink was also splashed on the bus. This continued for half an hour. Our bus was stranded there till 4 am and we, including all the passengers, were very scared as we didn't know the Kannada language either."" 
Repercussions of this incident are now likely to be felt in parts of Maharashtra as well. Uttam Patil, the divisional secretary of the MSRTC workers' union, said, ""There should be coordination between the two states regarding interstate traffic. The number of passengers travelling from Maharashtra to Karnataka is huge. If the corporation takes responsibility for the safety of drivers and conductors, we have no problem in going to Karnataka. MSRTC drivers and the general public are being dragged into the organisational and political tussle. The transport corporations of both states should sit together and decide on safety.""
